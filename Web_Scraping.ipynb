            "Pittsburgh (/ˈpɪtsbɜːrɡ/ PITS-burg) is a city in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, and its county seat. It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania (after Philadelphia) and the 67th-most populous city in the U.S., with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. The city is located in southwestern Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River.[8] It anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh–Weirton–Steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia.\n",
            "\n",
            "Pittsburgh is known as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry.[9] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[10] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[11] Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.[12] However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[13][14]\n",

            "Pittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Allegheny Health Network, as well as 68 colleges and universities, including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[15] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research, and the nuclear navy.[16] The city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Pittsburgh is sometimes called the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges.[9] Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[17] The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit.\n",

            "Pittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /ˈpɪtsbərə/ PITS-bər-ə (similar to Edinburgh).[18][19]\n",
            "\n",
            "Pittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[20]\n",
            "\"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"[21]\n",
            "\n",
            "From 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[22][18] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed.[18] The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921.[23]\n",

            "The area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[24] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.[25]: 289 \n",

            "The first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[26][better source needed] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[27]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[27] During 1753–1754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[28] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".[29]\n",
            "\n",
            "During Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[30][31][32][33]\n",
            "\n",
            "During this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".[34] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason–Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier.\n",

            "On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township.[35][36] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[37]\n",
            "\n",
            "Following the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory.\n",

            "\n",
            "The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from Germany.\n",
            "\n",
            "Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.[40] The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.[41] Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.[40]\n",
            "\n",
            "The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.\n",

            "The city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.[44] Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.[45] Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.[46]\n",
            "\n",
            "During World War II, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort.[29] This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\"[47][48] was being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\"[49]\n",

            "Following World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance,\" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.[12]\n",

            "In the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.\n",

The staccato qualities of the dialect are thought to originate either from Welsh or other European languages. The many local peculiarities have prompted The New York Times to describe Pittsburgh as \"the Galapagos Islands of American dialect\".[187] The lexicon itself contains notable loans from Polish and other European languages; examples include babushka, pierogi, and halušky.[188]\n",

            "Pittsburgh,  city, seat (1788) of Allegheny county, southwestern Pennsylvania, U.S. The city is located at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, which unite at the point of the “Golden Triangle” (the business district) to form the Ohio River. A city of hills, parks, and valleys, it is the centre of an urban industrial complex that includes the surrounding cities of Aliquippa (northwest), New Kensington (northeast), McKeesport (southeast), and Washington (southwest) and the borough of Wilkinsburg (east). Inc. borough, 1794; city, 1816. Area city, 58 square miles (150 square km). Pop. (2010) 305,704; Pittsburgh Metro Area, 2,356,285; (2020) 302,971; Pittsburgh Metro Area, 2,370,930.\n",

            "- History\n",
            "Algonquian- and Iroquoian-speaking peoples were early inhabitants of the region. The conflict between the British and French over territorial claims in the area was settled in 1758 when General John Forbes and his British and colonial army expelled the French from Fort Duquesne (built 1754). Forbes named the site for the British statesman William Pitt the Elder. The British built Fort Pitt (1761) to ensure their dominance at the source of the Ohio. Settlers began arriving after Native American forces led by Ottawa chief Pontiac were defeated in 1763; an agreement subsequently was made between Native American groups and the Penn family, and a boundary dispute was ended between Pennsylvania and Virginia. Pittsburgh was laid out (1764) by John Campbell in the area around the fort (now the Golden Triangle). Following the American Revolution, the town became an outfitting point for settlers traveling westward down the Ohio River.\n",
            "Pittsburgh’s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. A blast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the city’s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the “Iron City.” The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire.\n",
            "After the American Civil War, great numbers of European immigrants swelled Pittsburgh’s population, and industrial magnates such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellon built their steel empires there. The city became the focus of historic friction between labour and management, and the American Federation of Labor was born there in 1881.\n",
            "By 1900 the city’s population had reached 321,616. Growth continued nearly unabated through World War II, the war years bringing a particularly great boon for the economy. The population crested at more than 675,000 in 1950, after which it steadily declined; by the end of the century, it had returned almost to the 1900 level. Most citizens were still of European ancestry, but the growing African American proportion of the population exceeded one-fourth. During the period of economic and population growth, Pittsburgh had come to epitomize the grimy, polluted industrial city. After the war, however, the city undertook an extensive redevelopment program that emphasized smoke-pollution control, flood prevention, and sewage disposal. In 1957 it became the first American city to generate electricity by nuclear power.\n",
            "\n",
            "- The contemporary city\n",
            "By the late 1970s and early ’80s, the steel industry had virtually disappeared—a result of foreign competition and decreased demand. Many of the surrounding mill towns were laid to waste by unemployment, becoming a symbol of the notorious Rust Belt, the U.S. region where steelmaking and manufacturing once thrived before succumbing to widespread unemployment and poverty. Pittsburgh, however, successfully diversified its economy through more emphasis on light industries—though metalworking, chemicals, and plastics remained important—and on such high-technology industries as computer software, industrial automation (robotics), and biomedical and environmental technologies. Numerous industrial research laboratories were established in the area, and the service sector became increasingly important. Pittsburgh long has been one of the nation’s largest inland ports, and it remains a leading transportation centre.\n",
            "Much of the Golden Triangle has been rebuilt and includes Point State Park (containing Fort Pitt Blockhouse and Fort Pitt Museum), the Gateway Center (site of several skyscrapers and a garden), and the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. The University of Pittsburgh was chartered in 1787. Other educational institutions include Carnegie Mellon (1900), Duquesne (1878), Point Park (1960), Chatham (1869), and Carlow (1929) universities and two campuses of the Community College of Allegheny County (1966).\n",
            "Central to the city’s cultural life is the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh (formerly Carnegie Institute), an umbrella organization consisting of a number of institutions. Its museums include those for the fine arts and natural history (both founded in 1895), the Carnegie Science Center (1991), which now also houses the Henry Buhl, Jr., Planetarium and Observatory (1939), and the Andy Warhol Museum (1994), which exhibits the works of the Pittsburgh-born artist and filmmaker. Other institutions affiliated with the organization are the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, which contains more than 3.3 million volumes, and the Carnegie Music Hall. The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra performs at Heinz Hall, a restored movie theatre.\n",
            "Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens (1893), which covers 15 acres (6 hectares), is noted for its extensive greenhouses. The city’s zoo, in the northeastern Highland Park neighbourhood, includes an aquarium. Two new sports venues opened in 2001 on the north bank of the Allegheny opposite the Golden Triangle: PNC Park is home of the Pirates, the city’s professional baseball team, and Acrisure Stadium houses the Steelers, its professional football team. The Penguins, Pittsburgh’s professional ice hockey team, plays at PPG Paints Arena. Popular summertime attractions include riverboat excursions on Pittsburgh’s waterways and Kennywood, an amusement park southeast of the city in West Mifflin.\n"

            "The Great Search: Art in a Time of Change, 1928–1945 surveys the period from the beginning of the Great Depression to the end of World War II to demonstrate how pluralism was a hallmark of the modern American art world. This exhibition features works by Ernest Fiene, Arthur Dove, and others. Experience the second phase of this exciting exhibition with new artworks recently conserved and on view for the first time.The Great Search's title references American Art Today, the World’s Fair exhibition held in New York City in 1939. Organizer Holger Cahill, then national director of the Federal Art Project, spoke in his address of the modern artist’s “search that takes many paths”—a yearning desire to seek out new and enduring forms that would aid democracy. One of The Westmoreland’s best-known and loved paintings, Ernest Fiene’s Night Shift, Aliquippa (1936), was included in this pivotal presentation. Drawn primarily from The Westmoreland’s collection, amplified by key loans, the exhibition will provide fresh insight into the individuals, experiences, and both new and traditional aesthetics that define American modern art.\n",

Since its founding in 1825, each elected National Academician has donated a work to the collection, including portraits of members—either self-painted or created by fellow artists. These “diploma works” and “diploma portraits” are central to the Academy’s holdings and provide insight into the evolution of American art.\n",

Despite societal constraints, artists like Harriet Whitney Frishmuth, Malvina Hoffman, and Janet Scudder—who were queer women—used their focus on the nude human figure to assert their individuality and autonomy in an age of increasing, rapid mechanization and patriarchal control. The exhibition, drawn from The Westmoreland’s exceptional sculpture collection, celebrates the transformative gift from Dr. Michael L. Nieland in 2015.

            "Good Business: Andy Warhol’s Screenprints examines why screenprints are an essential part of Warhol’s body of work. Facilitating experimentation and mass distribution, prints can be simultaneously challenging and accessible.Warhol embraced mechanical processes early in his career and found in screenprinting the perfect vehicle for image repetition, both for his works on canvas and for portfolios of prints on paper. Through collaborations with his studio assistants and established print publishers, Warhol generated nearly 20,000 prints throughout his career. Screenprinting techniques allowed him to create series of images in an assortment of color variations, resulting in one of his most recognizable signatures (the same image rendered in different colorways), while the ability to generate editions of prints on paper enabled collectors to acquire masterworks at (relatively) affordable prices. The salability of prints also raised funds for causes that were personally important to him.Good Business: Andy Warhol’s Screenprints provides insight into the screenprinting process and highlights how Warhol used this technique to explore familiar themes throughout his career. Warhol was many things—a painter, photographer, film director, entrepreneur and commercial artist. Printmaker is a critical part of that extensive resume.Andy Warhol, $ (1), 1982, © The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.\n",

            "In 1898,Victor Herbertwas chosen to lead the orchestra.[1]The orchestra traveled at a more frequent rate under Herbert's tenure, performing inBoston, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Canada.[2]Its personnel included such musicians asLuigi von Kunits(later the first conductor of theToronto Symphony Orchestra) as concertmaster, first violinist Frederick William Stahlberg,[3]second violinistJohn Stepan Zamecnik, assistant principal celloGaston Borch, Paul Henneberg as first flute, and Leon Medaer as first clarinet.[4]\n",
            "Herbert composed two orchestral works that the Pittsburgh Orchestra premiered: hisSuite romantiqueop. 31 (which he also dedicated to the orchestra)[5]and thetone poemHero and Leanderop. 33.[6]Under Herbert's direction, the Pittsburgh Orchestra played as part of thePan-American Expositionat the 1901 World's Fair inBuffalo, New York, for which Herbert had also composed an original work for the exhibition titled \"Panamericana: Morceau Characteristique\" for the Orchestra to perform.[7]His tenure with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra ended in 1904 because of increasingly strident disagreements with the orchestra's manager, George H. Wilson, who disliked Herbert's populist manner and personally despised him.[8]\n",
            "When Herbert left the orchestra in 1904, the Symphony Society chose as his successor Austrian conductorEmil Paur.  Paur took an intellectual approach to his work and avoided theatrics.  Trained as a violinist, he had served as conductor of both theBoston Symphony Orchestraand theNew York Philharmonic, as well as guest conductor throughout Europe,[9]and held the Pittsburgh Orchestra to the same exacting standards.  Paur's programs emphasized the classical repertoire and increased the presence of works byJohannes Brahms, whose music was considered too challenging for most audiences at that time. Additionally, Paur clashed with many of the orchestra's musicians when he prohibited them from accepting outside performing engagements and continued to hire mainly European musicians.[10]Orchestra manager George H.

            "Originally, membership in the historical society was limited to men who had lived in the region for 50 years or more, though the rules changed within a few years to include women and younger people. In those days, members enjoyed lectures and country outings and got together to reminisce. Perhaps most importantly, early Historical Society members worked to preserve archival materials and objects of historic significance, forming the foundation of the History Center’s collections.\n",
            "The Historical Society brought our region’s history to the public. In 1908, it celebrated the region’s 150th anniversary; in 1911, the centennial of steamboat navigation; in 1958, the region’s bicentennial celebration; and in 2008, the region’s 250th anniversary. These events served as the basis for the many events, publications, educational programs, and exhibitions that the History Center offers today.\n",
            "Early meetings of the Historical Society were held in members’ homes and churches, though a significant step was taken in 1893 when the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh at Schenley Park offered space for the archives. In 1914, after securing the funding, the Historical Society built its own building on Bigelow Blvd. In 1996, the History Center moved into its current home in Pittsburgh’s Strip District.\n",
            "With the opening of the Smithsonian wing in 2004, the History Center became the largest history museum in Pennsylvania. The new wing allows better opportunities found in our affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution. The additional space added the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, the Mueller Education Center, the Special Collections Gallery, and the McGuinn Gallery for traveling exhibitions.\n",
            "Since its opening, the Smithsonian wing has been home to various exhibitions, including Pennsylvania’s Civil War, Vatican Splendors, 1968: The Year that Rocked America, Pittsburgh’s Lost Steamboat: Treasures of the Arabia, We Can Do It! WWII, Toys of the ’50s, ’60s and ’70s, #Pixburgh: A Photographic Experience, Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission.\n",
            "In 2014, the History Center opened the new Museum Conservation Center, located directly behind the museum on Penn Avenue. The nine-story building houses the museum’s artifacts under one roof with Smithsonian-quality storage.\n",

            "Today's museum began as an eleven-room, Italianate-style house purchased by the Fricks shortly after their marriage in 1881.  The house was built in the 1860s, original architect unknown.  After modifications by Pittsburgh architect Andrew Peebles, it was renamed \"Clayton\".  Further remodeling of the house was done in 1892 by Pittsburgh architectFrederick J. Osterling.  The Playhouse was constructed in 1897 to designs by architectsAlden & Harlow. The house served as the Fricks' primary residence from 1883 to 1905.  The Fricks moved to New York City in 1905, where they eventually established theFrick Collection, but in 1981 daughter Helen Clay Frick returned to Clayton, where she had previously spent part of each year, and remained there permanently until her death in 1984. Clayton opened to the public in 1990, and in 1997 the 1950s carriage house was enlarged to create the Car and Carriage Museum.[citation needed]\n",
            "In May 2013 the center announced a $15 million renovation to break ground on June 6, 2013.[1][2]The renovation was completed in 2015; the Car and Carriage Museum was expanded to twice its original size, and a community center and education center were built.[3]\n",

It has taken place inDowntown Pittsburghevery summer since 2015 (excluding 2020),[1]originally on theThree Sistersbridges and along theAllegheny Riverfront, before relocating to theBoulevard of the AlliesandPPG Placefor its 2023 installment.[2][3]\n",
            "The festival showcases \"all thingspickled,\" including pickle-flavoredbeerandcocktails, pickleice cream, and other pickled foods such asdilly beansandkimchi.[2][4][5]It also features live music, children's activities, and an annualpickle juicedrinking competition, the winner of which is crowned the \"Mayor of Picklesburgh\".[3]The festival's centerpiece is a 35-foot-long (11 m)Heinzpickleballoon.[6]\n",
            "The 9th annual Picklesburgh is scheduled to take place from July 11-13th of 2025. Picklesburgh was voted the \"best specialtyfood festivalin America\" inUSA Todayreaders' polls in 2019, 2020, 2023, and 2025.[7][8]\n",

            "The inaugural Picklesburgh festival took place on July 17 and 18, 2015, on theRachel Carson BridgeinDowntown Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania.[2]Organized by the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, a non-profit organization, and sponsored primarily by Pittsburgh-basedHeinz(nowKraft Heinz), the festival was inspired by Pittsburgh's rich history ofpickling.[9][10]Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership president Jeremy Waldrup explained that pickles \"speak to the ethnic, cultural history of Pittsburgh, as amelting potforEastern Europeanethnic communities\",[11]although numerous countries ofWestern culturewith significant diasporas in the United States, likeGermanyandPoland, also employ pickling in their national cuisines. According to Waldrup, the festival was also inspired by the growingfarm-to-tablemovement and the trend ofurban homesteading.[9]\n",
            "At Picklesburgh 2016, the second annual festival held at Rachel Carson Bridge, Heinz debuted their first new pickle flavors in over 50 years.[12]The 2017 festival was held at the nearbyRoberto Clemente Bridge, where it also took place in 2018 and 2019, gradually taking up more abutting street space each year.[13][14]Having begun as a two-day festival in 2015, a three-day schedule was established in 2018,[15]although a four-day schedule was used in 2024 before returning to three days in 2025.[16][17]Picklesburgh was canceled in 2020 due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, but it returned in 2021 with additional safety precautions on theAndy Warhol Bridge.[18]\n",
            "In 2022, the festival returned to its original locale on the Rachel Carson Bridge, with food vendors along the neighboring 10th Street Bypass.[19]Picklesburgh 2022 drew 90,000 attendees, leading organizers to periodically close the Rachel Carson Bridge to preventovercrowding.[20]Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership director Jack Dougherty remarked, \"At times, especially during our peak hours, it would get very crowded and just kind of become a little uncomfortable for everyone in attendance.\"[21]\n",
            "In response, for its 2023 installment, the festival was relocated to a larger venue occupying three blocks of theBoulevard of the AlliesbetweenStanwix Streetand Smithfield Street, and alongMarket StreetintoPPG Place.[6]Even with its larger location, Picklesburgh 2023 still saw enormous shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, with attendance more than doubling to 200,000 visitors.[22]Amid mid-summer heat and huge crowds, 16 attendees were hospitalized due toheat exhaustionand other ailments.[23]\n",

            "- Pickle juice drinking competition\n",
            "Since its founding in 2015, every Picklesburgh festival has featured apickle juicedrinking competition as its headline event.[24]In the competition, contestants race to drink aquart-sizedjarof pickle juice without regurgitating, spilling, or leaving any juice in the jar.[10][24]The winner is dubbed the \"Mayor of Picklesburgh\" and receives a belt and a $500 cash prize, as of 2023.[10][25]\n",
            "The 2023 champion and reigning \"Mayor of Picklesburgh\" is Pittsburgh native Dan Koba, who drank the jar of pickle juice in 7 seconds.[24]The all-time record was set at Picklesburgh 2022, whenWisconsin-basedTikTokcontent creator Jalen Franko won the competition by drinking the quart of juice in 4.5 seconds.[26]\n",

            "ThePittsburgh Piratesare an American professionalbaseballteam based inPittsburgh. The Pirates compete inMajor League Baseball(MLB) as a member club of theNational League(NL)Central Division. Founded as part of theAmerican Associationin 1881 under the name the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh, the club joined the National League in 1887 and was a member of theNational League Eastfrom 1969 through 1993. The Pirates have won fiveWorld Serieschampionships, nineNational League pennants, nine National League East division titles and made three appearances in theWild Card Game.\n",
            "The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball at the start of the 20th century, playing in theinaugural World Seriesin 1903 and winning their first title in1909behindHonus Wagner. The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the1960 World Seriesagainst theNew York Yankeeson awalk-off home runbyBill Mazeroski, the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They won again in1971behindRoberto Clemente, the first Latin-American enshrined in theNational Baseball Hall of Fame, and in1979under the leadership ofWillie Stargell.\n",
            "Since their last World Series in 1979, the Pirates have largely endured a period of great struggle. Since then, they have only had eleven winning seasons, six postseason appearances, three division titles, and have advanced just once in the postseason with a victory in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game. The Pirates additionally posted a losing record in 20 consecutive seasons from1993to2012, a record streak in both MLB and the four major North American professional sports leagues.[5]The Pirates currently have the fifth-longest World Series championship drought, the longest pennant drought in the National League,[6]and the longestLeague Championship Seriesappearance and division championship drought in all of baseball. From 1882 to 2024, the Pirates have an overall record of10,839–10,819–140(.500 winning 'percentage').[7]\n",
            "The Pirates are also often referred to as the \"Bucs\" or the \"Buccos\" (derived frombuccaneer, a synonym forpirate). Since 2001 the team has played its home games atPNC Park, a 39,000-seat stadium along theAllegheny Riverin Pittsburgh'sNorth Side. The Pirates previously played atForbes Fieldfrom 1909 to 1970 and atThree Rivers Stadiumfrom 1970 to 2000. Since 1948 the Pirates' colors have been black, gold and white, derived from theflag of Pittsburghand matching the other major professional sports teams in Pittsburgh, theSteelersand thePenguins.\n",
            "\n",
            "- History\n",
            "Professional baseball in the Pittsburgh area began in 1876 with the organization of theAllegheny Base Ball Club, an independent (non-league) club based in a then-separate city calledAllegheny City, across theAllegheny Riverfrom Pittsburgh. The team joined the minor leagueInternational Associationin 1877, only to fold the following season.[8]On October 15, 1881,Denny McKnightheld a meeting at Pittsburgh's St. Clair Hotel to organize a new Allegheny club,[9]which began play in 1882 as a founding member of theAmerican Association. Chartered as the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh,[10]the team was listed as \"Allegheny\" in the standings, and was sometimes called the \"Alleghenys\" (occasionally the \"Alleghenies\" or “Allies”) in that era's custom of referring to a team by its pluralized city or club name. After five mostly mediocre seasons, Pittsburgh became the firstA.A. teamto switch to the olderNational Leaguein 1887.[11]\n",
            "During the winter prior to the 1890 season, almost all of the Alleghenys' best players bolted to thePlayers' League'sPittsburgh Burghers. The Players' League collapsed after the season, and the players were allowed to go back to their old clubs. However, the Alleghenys also signed highly regarded second basemanLou Bierbauer, who had previously played with the A.A.'sPhiladelphia Athletics. Although the Athletics failed to include Bierbauer on their reserve list, they loudly protested the Alleghenys' move. In an official complaint, an AA official claimed the Alleghenys' signing of Bierbauer was \"piratical\".[12]This incident quickly accelerated into a schism between the leagues that contributed to the demise of the A.A. Although the Alleghenys were never found guilty of wrongdoing, their allegedly \"piratical\" act gained them the occasional nickname \"Pirates\" from newspapers around the country, starting in 1891. Within a few years, the nickname caught on with even Pittsburgh newspapers.[13]The nickname was first acknowledged on the team's uniforms in 1912.\n",
            "Early on, the Pirates organization finished no higher than 2nd in either league’s standings, but their fortunes began to change at the turn of the 20th century. The Pirates acquired several star players from theLouisville Colonels, who were slated for elimination when the N.L. contracted from 12 to 8 teams. (The franchises did not formally consolidate; the player acquisitions were separate transactions.)[14]Among those players wasHonus Wagner, who would become one of the first players inducted to theBaseball Hall of Fame. The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball in the early 1900s, winning three consecutive National League pennants from 1901 to 1903 and participating inthe first modern World Series ever played, which they lost toBoston. The Pirates returned to the World Series in1909, defeating theDetroit Tigersfor their first-ever world title. That year, the Pirates moved fromExposition Parkto one of the first steel and concrete ballparks,Forbes Field.\n",
            "As Wagner aged, the Pirates began to slip down the National League standings in the 1910s, culminating in a disastrous 51–103 record in 1917; however, veteran outfielderMax Careyand young playersPie TraynorandKiki Cuyler, along with a remarkably deep pitching staff, brought the Pirates back to relevance in the 1920s. The Pirates won their second title in1925, becoming the first team to come back from a 3–1 deficit in the World Series.[15]The Pirates returned to the World Series in1927but were swept by theMurderer's RowYankees. The Pirates remained a competitive team through the 1930s but failed to win the pennant, coming closest in 1938 when they were passed by theChicago Cubsin thefinal week of the season.\n",
            "Despite the prowess ofRalph Kineras a slugger during the latter half of the stretch, the Pirates were mostly undistinguished in the 1940s, and downright awful in the early 1950s.Branch Rickeywas brought in during this time to rebuild the team, which returned to the World Series in1960. They were largely outscored over the course of the series by theYankees, yet the Pirates won on a walk-off home run byBill Mazeroskiin the bottom of the 9th inning in Game 7. As of 2024, it is the only Game 7 walk-off home run in World Series history.\n",
            "Led by right fielderRoberto Clemente, the Pirates remained a strong team throughout the 1960s but did not return to the World Series until1971. Playing in the newThree Rivers Stadium, the Pirates defeated the favoredBaltimore Oriolesbehind Clemente's hitting and the pitching ofSteve Blass. In the same year on September 1, the Pirates became the first team to field an all-Black and Latino lineup.[16]Despite Clemente's death after the 1972 season, the Pirates were one of the dominant teams of the decade, winning the newly createdNational League Eastin1970,1971,1972,1974,1975, and1979. Powered by sluggers such asWillie Stargell,Dave Parker, andAl Oliver, the team was nicknamed \"The Lumber Company.\" Behind Stargell's leadership and thediscosong\"We Are Family\"(which the team adopted as its theme song), the Pirates came back from a 3–1 deficit to once again defeat theOriolesin the1979 World Seriesfor the franchise's fifth championship. During the 1979 championship season, a Pittsburgh player was designated as Most Valuable Player in every available category: All-Star Game MVP (Dave Parker), NLCS MVP (Willie Stargell), World Series MVP (Willie Stargell), and National League MVP (Willie Stargell, shared with Keith Hernandez of St. Louis).\n",
            "The Pirates sank back into mediocrity in the 1980s and returned to post-season play in the early 1990s behind young players likeBarry Bonds,Bobby Bonilla, andDoug Drabek. The Pirates won three straight division titles from 1990 to 1992 but lost in theNational League Championship Serieseach time, notably coming within one out of advancing to the World Series in1992. Several of the team's best players, including Bonds and Drabek, left as free agents after that season.\n",
            "With salaries rising across baseball, the small-market Pirates struggled to keep pace with the sport and they posted a losing record for 20 consecutive seasons, a record among North American professional sports teams. Even the opening of a new stadium in 2001,PNC Park, did little to change the team's fortunes. The Pirates finally returned to the postseason in2013behind National League MVPAndrew McCutchen, defeating theCincinnati Redsin theWild Card Game. They were eliminated in five games in thenext roundby theSt. Louis Cardinals. That season, the Pirates also became the seventh MLB team to reach 10,000 all-time  wins.[17]OnOpening Day2015 the Pirates' loss was the team's 10,000th[18]making the Pirates the fourth MLB team to achieve this distinction, following thePhiladelphia Phillies,Atlanta Braves, and the Chicago Cubs.[19]The Pirates returned to the postseason in 2014 and 2015 and lost the Wild Card game both times and have not qualified for the playoffs since then.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Ballpark\n",
            "Since 2001, the Pirates have played their home games atPNC Park, located on the banks of theAllegheny Riverin Pittsburgh's North Side neighborhood. The park was built as a replacement for the agingThree Rivers Stadium, a dual-purpose stadium that had been designed for functionality rather than aesthetics.[20]Funded mainly through taxpayer money, the ballpark cost $216 million to construct and is named for Pittsburgh-basedPNC Financial Services.[21]PNC Park's listed capacity is 38,747 for baseball, although standing-room only space can accommodate more than 40,000 fans; the biggest crowd in stadium history was the2015 National League Wild Card Game, when 40,889 fans saw the Cubs defeat the Pirates 4–0.\n",
            "Widely considered to be among the best baseball stadiums in the country, several outlets have praised PNC Park for its location, limestone and steel façade, and views of both the action on the field and the Pittsburgh skyline.[22][23][24][25]PNC Park was the first two-deck ballpark to be built in the United States since Milwaukee County Stadium opened in 1953;[26]as a result, fans in the upper deck are closer to the action than at most ballparks, with the highest seat in the stadium 88 feet (27 m) above the playing surface. Fans in the lower deck are also closer to the field: the batter is closer to the seats behind home plate than to the pitcher,[27]and seating along the baselines is 45 feet  from the bases at their closest point. A four-level steel rotunda down the left field line offers extensive standing room only space, and action on the field can be seen from the first-level concourse. PNC Park has a reputation as a pitcher's park, with a deep left field that juts out to more than 410 feet from home plate. Right field is closer, but the wall is 21 feet high, nicknamed the Clemente Wall after former right-fielderRoberto Clemente, who wore number 21. Statutes of Clemente,Willie Stargell,Bill MazeroskiandHonus Wagnerare located at several entrances to the stadium. In addition to hosting Pirate games, PNC Park hosted the2006 MLB All-Star Gameand has been the site of several concerts.\n",
            "PNC Park is located near several major highways and parking is available in the blocks around the ballpark. Fans can also walk to the stadium fromdowntown Pittsburghvia theClemente Bridge, or takePittsburgh Light Railto the system'sNorth Side station, located just outside the stadium's home plate entrance.\n",
            "\n",
            "-- Former ballparks\n",
            "The Pirates' first home wasExposition Park, located a couple blocks west of the current location of PNC Park. The Pirates split their early years between that ballpark andRecreation Park, which was located further inland from the flood-prone Allegheny River. The Pirates moved back to Exposition Park for good in 1891, and remained there until the middle of the 1909 season.[28]The park hosted thefirst modern World Series ever playedin 1903, but by the end of the decade the wooden structure was too small for the Pirates' growing fanbase. Exposition Park hosted several minor league teams before being razed prior to 1920.[29]The site, currently occupied by a parking lot and several restaurants, is marked by a state historical marker (near the intersection of West Gen. Robinson Street and Tony Dorsett Drive) and a sunken home plate marker made of steel (a few paces away, in the parking lot) , both noting the 1903 World Series.\n",
            "In the middle of the 1909 season, the Pirates moved intoForbes FieldinOakland, which would serve as the club's home for the next 61 years. Built at a cost of $1 million, the park was the first three-tiered steel-and-concrete ballpark in the nation.[30]Forbes Field was expanded several times over the decades, with capacity almost doubled from its initial 23,000 in 1909 to 41,000 in 1925 (although it was reduced to 35,000 in its later years). Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss \"hated cheaphome runsand vowed he'd have none in his park\", which led him to design a large playing field for Forbes Field.[31]When a large grandstand was constructed down the right field line in the early 1920s, reducing the distance to 300 feet from home plate, Dreyfuss had a 28-foot screen erected.[32][33][34]Despite this, Forbes Field is remembered for several famous home runs: the final three homers ofBabe Ruth's career on May 25, 1935[35]and Bill Mazeroski's championship-winning blast in Game 7 of the1960 World Series. The park also hostedfootballgames for thePittsburgh SteelersandUniversity of Pittsburgh\"Pitt\" Panthers. Located in a sparsely populated area of the city when it opened in 1909, by the 1960s Forbes Field was surrounded by the University of Pittsburgh campus. The Pirates left the ballpark midway through the 1970 season and the stadium was demolished the following year. Sections of the outfield wall remain standing along Roberto Clemente Drive, and the home plate used in the stadium's final game remains preserved in the University of Pittsburgh'sPosvar Hall.[36][37]\n",
            "The Pirates moved into the multipurposeThree Rivers Stadiumin 1970, which they shared with the Steelers. Like othermulti-purpose stadiumspopular at the time, Three Rivers featured extensive box seats, a turf playing field, and moveable seating sections to accommodate both football and baseball. Three Rivers ended up being much better suited for the former than the latter, and the Pirates struggled to draw fans despite their on-field success in the 1970s. By the 1990s, the Pirates were threatening to leave Pittsburgh unless a new, baseball-only stadium was constructed. The Pirates played their final game at Three Rivers on October 1, 2000, and the stadium was demolished the following winter. The site is currently occupied by parking lots andStage AE, although one of the stadium's entrance markers remains standing nearAcrisure Stadium. In 2012, members of theSociety for American Baseball Researchmarked and painted thehome plateand first base of the former stadium on the 40th Anniversary of Roberto Clemente's 3,000th hit.[38]Since then, markers have been placed at the locations of home plate, second base, and the pitcher’s plate.\n",
            "\n",
            "-- Spring Training\n",
            "Since 1969, the Pirates have heldSpring TrainingatLECOM ParkinBradenton, Florida, which is also used for the Pirates' minor league team, theBradenton Marauders. Constructed in 1923, LECOM Park is the oldest stadium still in use for Spring Training and the second-oldest minor league park, behind onlyJackie Robinson BallparkinDaytona Beach, which dates to 1914.[39]It is also the third oldest stadium currently used by a major league team afterFenway Park, built in 1912, andWrigley Field, built in 1914.[40]Built in a Florida Spanish Mission style, LECOM Park underwent two major renovations in 1993 and 2008, the latter of which added lights.[41]The park was formerly named \"McKechnie Field,\" for Bradenton resident and Baseball Hall of Fame greatBill McKechnie, who led the Pirates in1925; since 2017 it has been named for theLake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine, which has its main campus inErie, Pennsylvania, and also a campus in Bradenton.[42]Pirate City, the site of the Pirates' Spring Training complex, is located a few miles east of LECOM Park.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Logos and uniforms\n",
            "The Pirates have had many uniforms and logo changes over the years, with the only consistency being the \"P\" on the team's cap. Like other teams in Major League Baseball, the Pirates predominantly favored a patriotic red, white and blue color scheme through the first half of the 20th Century.[43]During this time, the Pirates predominantly wore a blue cap, with either a red or white P. The uniforms were plain, often including a simple \"P\" if anything at all. The team's name was first acknowledged in 1912, with a pinstripe jersey that had \"Pirates\" running vertically down the placket.[43]The team's name would not appear on the club's uniforms again until they were added to the road uniforms in 1933, this time written horizontally in a more ornate style. An image of a pirate's head appeared on the home and road jerseys for the 1940 and 1941 seasons (this image would be reused for the team's logo in the 1980s and 1990s), and \"Pittsburgh\" first appeared on the road uniforms in 1942.[43]\n",
            "In 1948, the team broke away from the patriotic \"Red, White, & Blue\" color scheme when they adopted the current black & gold color scheme, to match that of the colors of theFlag of Pittsburghand, to a lesser extent at the time, the colors of the then-relatively unknownPittsburgh Steelersof theNational Football League. The Pirates had made a similar change to black and gold in 1924,[44][45][46]but the change did not last beyond that season.[47][48]Along with theSan Francisco Giants, the Pirates are one of two pre-expansionNational Leagueteams that completely changed their colors, although red returned as an \"accent color\" in 1997 and remained until 2009.\n",
            "In the late 1950s, the team adopted sleeveless jerseys. While not an innovation by the team (the honor goes to theCincinnati Reds), the Pirates helped popularize the look. Coinciding with the move intoThree Rivers Stadiumin 1970, the team switched to a darker shade of gold and changed their caps from black to gold with a black brim; they also introduced pullover nylon/cotton jerseys and beltless pants as part of their new uniform set (later to become polyester doubleknit).[43]The Pirates became the first team in baseball to sport such a look, but it quickly became popular throughout the league, and the pullover style would become the prominent look of 1970s and 1980s baseball. The Pirates ditched the pullover style in favor of the traditional button-down style in 1991, one of the last teams to switch.\n",
            "In 1976, the National League celebrated its 100th anniversary. To coincide with it, certain NL teams wore old-style pillbox hats complete with horizontalpinstripes. After the season, the Pirates were the only team to adopt the hats permanently, alternating between a black hat and a gold hat for several seasons.[43]The Pirates switched back to a brighter shade of gold for the 1977 season, and became one of the first teams to wearthird jerseys, following theOakland Athletics. Starting in1977, the Pirates had uniform styles which included two different caps and three different uniforms: an all-black set, an all-gold set, and a white set with black-and-gold pinstripes. The pants, tops and caps could all be worn interchangeably for different looks; the Pirates wore four different uniform combinations in the1979 World Series. The pinstripes came off the white uniforms in 1980, but the Pirates continued to utilize the three uniform set until the 1985 season, when the team returned to the straightforward home whites/road grays combination. The solid black cap with a gold \"P\" returned in 1987 and has been the team's primary cap ever since.[43]\n",
            "AfterKevin McClatchypurchased the team in 1996, the Pirates added a third jersey and utilized red as an accent color, including red brims on the team's caps. A sleeveless white jersey with pinstripes was worn as an alternate home jersey from 2005 to 2010, and a red alternate jersey was added for the 2007 and 2008 seasons. In2009, the Pirates began wearing an alternate black jersey with a gold \"P\" at both home and on the road.[43]From 2013 to 2019, the Pirates wore throwback uniforms for Sunday home games: the early 70s pullover uniforms from 2013 to 2015, and the gold top/black pants from the late 70s from 2016 to 2019.[49]\n",
            "Since the2015 season, the Pirates have worn an alternate camo jersey for select home games.[50]The camouflage alternates were updated for the2018 season, now white with camo green wordmarks, numbers, piping, and patches.[51]\n",
            "Ahead of the2020 season, the Pirates revived the script \"Pittsburgh\" wordmarks on their gray road and new black alternate road jerseys, which were unveiled on January 24, 2020. Script wordmarks had previously been seen on the road jerseys from 1990 until 2000. The alternate road jersey also features a Pirate wearing a re-colored bandana, yellow to match the theme of the jersey, and is worn with a black cap featuring the \"P\" logo outlined in black and yellow.[52]In addition to these road uniforms, the Pirates continue to wear their white uniforms, the black alternate with the gold \"P\", and the camo alternate for games played at PNC Park.\n",
            "In 2023, the Pirates retired the camo home alternate to comply with the new \"4+1\" rule, restricting teams to a home, away, two alternate uniforms and aCity Connectuniform. The Pirates continued to wear the camo cap on occasion with the home white uniform. They also unveiled their City Connect uniform, featuring a gold top and black pants with a gold \"P\" cap with black brim. The jersey itself features the abbreviation of Pittsburgh \"PGH\". A closer look of the jersey feature the Three Elements. The inverted \"Y\", representing the three rivers that meet in Pittsburgh (Allegheny,Monongahela, andOhio). The astroid, or the diamond shape star represents the famous \"Steelmark\" logo and the Check or the Checkbox, represents the Seal of Pittsburgh.[53]\n",

            "The Phillies and the Pirates remained together after the National League split into two divisions in 1969. During the period of two-division play (1969–1993), the twoNational League Eastdivision rivals won the two highest numbers of division championships, reigning almost exclusively as NL East champions in the 1970s and again in the early 1990s.[56][58][59]The Pirates nine, the Phillies six; together, the two teams' 15 championships accounted for more than half of the 25 NL East championships during that span.[58]\n",
            "After the Pirates moved to theNational League Centralin 1994, the teams face each other only in two series each year and the rivalry has diminished.[55][56]However, many fans, especially older ones, retain their dislike for the other team, with regional differences betweenEasternandWestern Pennsylvaniastill fueling the rivalry.[60]\n",

In the 2010s, the two teams frequentlyhit each other with pitches, occasionally resulting in brawls.[62]\n",

The two teams faced off in the2013 National League Division Series, which the Cardinals won in five games. The Pirates had a contentious[63]battle with theMilwaukee Brewersfor a Wild Card spot in 2014 and faced off against theChicago Cubsin the2015 National League Wild Card Game. The Cubs were major rivals for the Pirates earlier in their history, as both were among the best teams in baseball in the early 1900s and the Cubs eliminated the Pirates from the pennant race in the last week ofthe 1938 season.\n",

While the Pirates and Tigers only became \"natural rivals\" because the other AL and NL Central teams were already paired up, it has become popular with fans of both teams, possibly due to the rivalry between theNational Hockey League'sDetroit Red WingsandPittsburgh Penguins. The two teams have several other connections as well. The Tigers' AA Minor League affiliate, theErie SeaWolves, located near Pittsburgh, is a former affiliate of the Pirates and has retained the logo of a wolf wearing a pirate bandanna and eye patch. Additionally, Jim Leyland, former manager of both the Pirates (1986–1996) and the Tigers (2005–2013), remains popular in Pittsburgh where he resides. The Pirates led the regular-season series, 36–29. The two teams played in the1909 World Series.\n",

Because the Guardians' designated interleague rival is the Reds and the Pirates' designated rival is the Tigers, the teams have only played periodically.  The teams played one three-game series each year from 1997 to 2001 and periodically between 2002 and 2022, generally only in years in which the AL Central played the NL Central in the former interleague play rotation. The teams played six games in 2020 as MLB instituted an abbreviated schedule focusing on regional match-ups. Beginning in 2023, the teams will play a three-game series each season as a result of the new \"balanced\" schedule.  The Pirates lead the series 21–19.[64]\n",

In 1976, the Steelers kept their playoff hopes alive (they later won the division) with a late-season 7–3 win in snowy Cincinnati. One of the most memorable games was the 2005 AFC Wildcard playoff game, in which the Steelers, en route to a Super Bowl title, won a 31–17 come-from-behind victory after Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer was forced to leave the game with a knee injury. The injury happened when nose tackle Kimo von Oelhoffen contacted Palmer's knee during a passing play.[113] The Bengals players called this a dirty play; the NFL ruled that it was accidental and did not fine von Oelhoffen for the hit. The incident led to an intensifying of the rivalry. The Bengals beat the Steelers in Week 13 of the 2005 season 38–31, and wide receiver T. J. Houshmandzadeh used a Terrible Towel to polish his cleats while walking up the tunnel after the game, fueling the rivalry. The Steelers and Bengals finished 2005 and 2006 with identical records (11–5 and 8–8 respectively), splitting both regular-season series, the Bengals winning the tiebreaker both years due to having a superior division record. The Steelers also are responsible for ending the Bengals' season in Cincinnati two years in a row, eliminating them from the playoffs in 2005 and taking them out of contention in 2006. The rivalry has become more intense again since the 2015 season. A central figure is Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict, often inflicting brutal hits, resulting in serious injuries to several Steelers on multiple occasions. In the 2015 Wild Card playoff game in Cincinnati, Burfict was the culprit of a late penalty directly responsible for an extremely unlikely 18–16 Steelers comeback victory.[60] The Steelers lead the all-time series, 63–35.[114] The teams have met twice in the postseason, with the Steelers winning both times.[115]\n",

            "The New England Patriots emerged as a prominent rival in league circles when the Patriots upset the Steelers in the 2001 AFC Championship Game at Heinz Field, though the two teams had met in the postseason twice before; the Patriots defeated the Steelers in 1996 28–3 while the Steelers won 7–6 in 1997; both times, the Patriots fielded players with Pittsburgh-area roots in Ty Law and Curtis Martin. Martin's final game with the Patriots was in the 1997 playoffs before he departed to the rival New York Jets. Following the 2001 AFC title upset, the Patriots defeated the Steelers 30–14 at the start of the 2002 season. Pittsburgh did not exact revenge for the two losses until ending the Patriots' record-setting 21-game winning streak in week 6 of the 2004 NFL season. Later that season, the Steelers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Patriots in the AFC Championship game after a 15–1 regular season.\n",

The Patriots in 2013 then made history by becoming the first opponent to score 55 points on the Steelers, winning 55–31. The Patriots won again in 2015 (28–21) and 2016's regular season (27–16) and then won 36–17 in the 2016 AFC Championship Game. They also won in 2017 when a go-ahead touchdown reception by Steelers' tight end Jesse James was controversially called back.[116] Though they ultimately missed the playoffs, the Steelers defeated the Patriots by a score of 17–10 on December 16, 2018, in Pittsburgh.\n",

The Oilers were aligned into the AFC Central with the Steelers in 1970 and were division rivals for 32 seasons. The Steelers dominated the rivalry during the Houston era and defeated the Oilers in all three of their playoff matchups. However, since the franchise moved to Tennessee in 1997, the rivalry shifted, with the Titans winning 13 of 22 meetings (including a bitter 34–31 playoff showdown in 2002); the Titans won seven in a row in the 1997–2001 period, the longest win streak by either team in the series.

The Steelers' rivalry with the Broncos dates from 1970, but the first notable contest came in 1973, when Denver dealt Pittsburgh its first regular-season defeat at Three Rivers Stadium, 23–13. The following year, they met in the NFL's first regular-season overtime game, which ended in a 35–35 tie. Denver's first playoff game had them hosting the Steelers in the 1977 divisional round; the Broncos won 34–21. The following year, the Steelers hosted and defeated Denver 33–10 in the divisional round. Their next playoff matchup was the 1984 divisional round in Mile High Stadium; the Steelers pulled the upset 24–17.

In 2011, after appearing in Super Bowl XLV, the Steelers had their campaign to repeat as AFC Champions dashed in Denver after a stunning overtime upset by the Tim Tebow-led Broncos in January 2012, in what would become known as the \"316 game\". The following September the Steelers were defeated in Denver 31–19 in Peyton Manning's debut as Broncos quarterback. The two clubs met twice in 2015, as the Steelers defeated the Broncos in the regular season but fell in the Divisional Round of the AFC playoffs; through the 2021 season, Denver leads the series 20–13–1, including 5–3 in the playoffs.[120] Neither team has beaten the other more than three times in a row.

            "-- Oakland Raiders\n",
            "The Steelers' rivalry with the Raiders was one of the most heated battles of the 1970s and early to mid-1980s. The Steelers' first playoff victory in franchise history came against the Raiders, which occurred on December 23, 1972, in a 13–7 victory over the Raiders; the victory occurred when Terry Bradshaw threw a pass intended for John Fuqua that was deflected into the hands of Franco Harris, who scooped the ball from nearly hitting the ground and carried the ball in for a touchdown, which was later referred to as the Immaculate Reception, while attracting controversy from Raiders players and coaches, who alleged that the ball had bounced off Fuqua, which would have made it an illegal play per the rules of the time.[121] The victory sent Pittsburgh to their first ever AFC Championship Game. The following year, the two teams met in the Divisional Round again, and the Raiders responded with a 33–14 victory to advance to the AFC title game. However, Pittsburgh fired back with two straight AFC Championship victories over the Raiders in 1974 (24–13) and 1975 (16–10) to reach the Super Bowl. The Raiders responded with a victory over Pittsburgh in the 1976 AFC Championship game 24–7 (the third consecutive AFC title game between the two teams), but not before Chuck Noll referred to Raider George Atkinson as part of the NFL's \"criminal element\" after his alleged cheap-shot on Lynn Swann during a regular-season matchup. Atkinson and the Raiders later filed a defamation of character lawsuit against Noll, but lost. Following the 1983 regular season, the Los Angeles Raiders defeated the Steelers 38–10 in the AFC Divisional round which turned out to be the last NFL game for Steeler Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw who did not play due to injury.\n",
            "\n",
            "While the rivalry has dissipated over the years (mostly due to the Raiders decline after 2002), the teams have had notable games against each other, including an upset Steelers victory towards the end of the 2000 season to prevent the Raiders from obtaining homefield advantage in the playoffs, and an upset Raiders victory in week 8 of the 2006 NFL season (20–13), which helped cost the Steelers a playoff berth. In Week 13 of the 2009 season, another Raiders upset victory happened; the game lead changed five times on five touchdowns in the fourth quarter until Raiders QB Bruce Gradkowski's third touchdown of the quarter won it with nine seconds to go. The 27–24 loss cost the Steelers another playoff run. The teams met at Pittsburgh in 2010, where the Steelers blew out the Raiders 35–3, and ended their 3-game winning streak; the game was further notable for a punch thrown by Richard Seymour of the Raiders against Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. The Raiders then hosted the Steelers in 2012 and erased a 31–21 gap to win 34–31. The two clubs met again in 2013 and the Raiders won again, 21–18.

A lifeless performance in a 23–18 loss at Vegas on September 23, 2023, contributed to the later firing of Raiders coach Josh McDaniels and GM Dave Ziegler.

These teams hold a record for the most times (three) that two teams have met in a Super Bowl. The first two times the favored Steelers and Cowboys met came with Pittsburgh victories in the Orange Bowl Super Bowl X 21–17 and Super Bowl XIII 35–31. The Cowboys never won a regular-season game in the Orange Bowl and lost three Super Bowl games (once to the Baltimore Colts and twice to the Steelers). Between the Cowboys and Steelers, Super Bowl XIII had the greatest number of future Pro Football Hall of Fame players participating, which as of 2021 numbered 25 – 16 players and nine coaches/front office, including Ernie Stautner, defensive coordinator for the Cowboys who was a HoF defensive tackle for the Steelers. The teams featured an all-star matchup at quarterback between the Steelers' Terry Bradshaw and the Cowboys' Roger Staubach, both of whom are in the Hall of Fame. In 1977, Staubach and the Cowboys won Super Bowl XII, their second and last loss of their season being inflicted by Bradshaw and the Steelers, 28–13 at Three Rivers Stadium in November. In 1979, Staubach's final season, the two defending conference champs met again at Three Rivers, the Steelers winning 14–3 en route to winning their fourth Super Bowl title. The Steelers won six of eight meetings during the 1970s and 80s, before the Cowboys won all four meetings during the 1990s, including the teams' record third Super Bowl meeting in 1996, as this time the heavily favored Cowboys beat the Steelers 27–17. Dallas cornerback Larry Brown intercepted Pittsburgh quarterback Neil O'Donnell twice and was named the game's MVP. The teams' first two meetings of the 21st century (2004 and 2008) were won by the Steelers, including a come from behind victory on December 7, 2008, in Pittsburgh, when the Steelers drove the length of the field to tie the game 13–13, then cornerback Deshea Townsend returned an intercepted pass from Tony Romo for the game's final score, Steelers 20, Cowboys 13. The Cowboys won on December 16, 2012, at Cowboys Stadium by a 27–24 margin in overtime and won 35–30 at Heinz Field on November 13, 2016. The all-time series is led by the Dallas Cowboys, 17–16.[125] The Pittsburgh/Dallas rivalry served as a backdrop to the 1977 film Black Sunday, parts of which were filmed during Super Bowl X.

From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division. In 1967, they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years. In 1970 the Steelers (along with the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Colts) moved to the American Football Conference, while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the National Football Conference. As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season. The most recent meeting was in 2024 at Lincoln Financial Field, a game in which the Eagles won 27-13. The Steelers have lost 11 straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the Super Bowl era. The Eagles lead the all-time series 50-29–3.[126]\n",

            "-- Early years (1967–1984)\n",
            "Prior to the arrival of the Penguins, Pittsburgh had been the home of the NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates from 1925 to 1930 and of the American Hockey League's Pittsburgh Hornets franchise from 1936 to 1967 (with a short break from 1956 to 1961). In the spring of 1965, Jack McGregor, a state senator from Kittanning, Pennsylvania, began lobbying campaign contributors and community leaders to bring an NHL franchise back to Pittsburgh. The group focused on leveraging the NHL as an urban renewal tool for Pittsburgh. The senator formed a group of local investors that included H. J. Heinz Company heir H. J. Heinz III, Pittsburgh Steelers' owner Art Rooney and the Mellon family's Richard Mellon Scaife. The projected league expansion depended on securing votes from the then-current NHL owners; to ensure Pittsburgh would be selected as one of the expansion cities, McGregor enlisted Rooney to petition votes from James D. Norris, owner of the Chicago Black Hawks and his brother Bruce Norris, owner of the Detroit Red Wings. The effort was successful, and on February 8, 1966, the National Hockey League awarded an expansion team to Pittsburgh for the 1967–68 season. The Penguins paid $2.5 million ($24.5 million today) for their entry and $750,000 ($7.1 million today) more for start-up costs. The Civic Arena's capacity was boosted from 10,732 to 12,500 to meet the NHL requirements for expansion. The Penguins also paid an indemnification bill to settle with the Detroit Red Wings, which owned the Pittsburgh Hornets franchise. The investor group named McGregor president and chief executive officer, and he represented Pittsburgh on the NHL's Board of Governors.[5][6]\n",
            "\n",
            "A contest was held where 700 of 26,000 entries picked \"Penguins\" as the team's nickname, sharing its nickname with the athletic department of the newly named Youngstown State University in nearby Youngstown, Ohio. (Youngstown is part of the Penguins' territorial rights to this day, though they did briefly share them with the Cleveland Barons in the mid-1970s.) Mark Peters had the winning entry (which was inspired because the team was to play in the \"Igloo\", the nickname of the Pittsburgh Civic Arena),[7][8] a logo was chosen that had a penguin in front of a triangle, which symbolized the \"Golden Triangle\" of downtown Pittsburgh.[7][9] The Penguins' first general manager, Jack Riley, opened the first pre-season camp for the franchise in Brantford, Ontario,[10] on September 13, 1967, playing the franchise's first exhibition match in Brantford against the Philadelphia Flyers on September 23, 1967. Restrictive rules which kept most major talent with the existing \"Original Six\" teams hampered the Penguins, along with the rest of the expansion teams. Beyond aging sniper Andy Bathgate, all-star defenseman Leo Boivin (who had begun his professional career with the Hornets) and New York Rangers' veteran Earl Ingarfield, a cast of former minor leaguers largely manned the first Penguins' team. Several players played for the Hornets the previous season: Bathgate, wingers Val Fonteyne and Ab McDonald, and goaltenders Hank Bassen and Joe Daley. George Sullivan was named the head coach for the club's first two seasons, and McDonald was named the team's first captain.[11]\n",
            "\n",
            "On October 11, 1967, league president Clarence Campbell and McGregor jointly dropped the ceremonial first puck of the Penguins' opening home game against the Montreal Canadiens.[5] On October 21, 1967, they became the first team from the expansion class to defeat an Original Six team, as they defeated the Chicago Black Hawks 4–2. However, the Penguins went 27–34–13 and finished in fifth place in the West Division, missing the playoffs and ending with the third-worst record in the league. The team's best player proved to be longtime Cleveland Barons AHL goaltender Les Binkley, who recorded a 2.88 goals-against average and was second in the league with six shutouts. Defensive winger Ken Schinkel won the team's sole league honor, being named to represent the Penguins in the NHL All-Star Game. Bathgate led the team in scoring with 59 points but retired at season's end. McDonald, who led the team in goals and was second in team scoring, was also gone at season's end, traded to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for center Lou Angotti.[6]\n",
            "\n",
            "The next season saw the team slip in the standings amid a sharp drop in form by Binkley, into sixth place and with the league's worst record. Several changes were made to improve the team, resulting in Boivin and several others being traded, and new players – including longtime future Penguins star Jean Pronovost – making their debuts. No captain was named to replace McDonald; the team went with four alternate captains.\n",

            "-- Triumph of playoff berths and tragedy of Briere (1969–1974)\n",
            "In the 1969 draft the Penguins selected Michel Briere who, although being chosen 26th, was soon drawing comparisons to Phil Esposito and Bobby Clarke. Joining the team in November, he finished as the second-place rookie scorer in the NHL (behind Bobby Clarke) with 44 points (57th overall), and third on the Penguins. Briere placed second in Calder Memorial Trophy voting for Rookie of the Year honors behind Chicago goaltender Tony Esposito. Briere led Pittsburgh to its first NHL playoff berth since the 1928 Pirates. The Penguins defeated the Oakland Seals in a four-game sweep in the quarterfinals, with Briere scoring the series-clinching goal in overtime. In the semifinals, defending conference champions St. Louis Blues got the best of the Penguins during six games. Briere led the team in playoff scoring, recording five goals (including three game-winners) and eight points. Tragedy struck the Penguins just days after their playoff heroics. On May 15, 1970, Briere was in a car crash in his native Quebec, suffering brain trauma and slipping into a coma from which he would never recover; he died a year later. His number 21 jersey was never reissued, remaining out of circulation until it was formally retired in 2001.[6]\n",
            "\n",
            "In the 1970–71 season, the Penguins finished five games out of the playoffs with a 21–37–20 record, the fourth-worst record in the league. Pittsburgh achieved a playoff berth in 1972, only to be swept by the Chicago Black Hawks in the first round. Except for a handful of players like Ken Schinkel, Pronovost, Syl Apps Jr., Keith McCreary, agitator Bryan Watson and goaltender Les Binkley, talent was thin, but enough for the Penguins to reach the playoffs in both 1970 and 1972.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Penguins battled the California Golden Seals for the division cellar in 1974, when Riley was fired as general manager and replaced by Jack Button. Button obtained Steve Durbano, Ab DeMarco, Bob \"Battleship\" Kelly and Bob Paradise through trades. The personnel moves proved successful, and the team improved to a 28–41–9 record, although they remained nine points away from a playoff berth.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, in early 1975, the Penguins' creditors demanded payment of back debts, forcing the team into bankruptcy. The doors to the team's offices were padlocked, and it looked like the Penguins would fold or relocate.[12] Around the same time, rumors began circulating that the Penguins and the California Golden Seals were to be relocated to Seattle and Denver respectively, the two cities that were to have been the sites of an expansion for the 1976–77 season.[13] Through the intervention of a group that included former Minnesota North Stars head coach Wren Blair, the team was prevented from folding and remained in Pittsburgh, eventually being bought by shopping mall magnate Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "-- Playoff runs and a uniform change (1974–1982)\n",
            "Beginning in the mid-1970s, Pittsburgh iced some powerful offensive clubs, led by the likes of the \"Century Line\" of Syl Apps, Lowell MacDonald and Jean Pronovost. They nearly reached the semifinals in 1975, but were ousted from the playoffs by the New York Islanders in one of the only four best-of-seven-game series in NHL history where a team came back from being down three games to none. As the 1970s wore on, a mediocre team defense neutralized the Penguins' success beyond the regular season. Baz Bastien, a former coach and general manager of the AHL's Hornets, later became general manager. The Penguins missed the playoffs in 1977–78. Bastien traded prime draft picks for several players whose best years were already behind them, and the team would suffer in the early 1980s as a result. The decade closed with a playoff appearance in 1979 and a rousing opening series win over the Buffalo Sabres before a second-round sweep at the hands of the Boston Bruins.[6]\n",
            "\n",
            "The Penguins began the 1980s by changing their team colors; in January 1980, the team switched from wearing blue and white to their present-day scheme of black and gold to honor Pittsburgh's other sports teams, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Pittsburgh Steelers, as well as the Flag of Pittsburgh. Both the Pirates and Steelers had worn black and gold for decades, and both had enjoyed world championship seasons. The Bruins protested this color change, claiming a monopoly on black and gold, but the Penguins defended their choice stating that the NHL Pirates also used black and gold as their team colors and that black and gold were Pittsburgh's traditional sporting colors. The NHL agreed, and Pittsburgh could use black and gold. The Penguins officially debuted the black and gold uniform in a game against the St. Louis Blues at the Civic Arena on January 30, 1980.[14] On the ice, the Penguins began the 1980s with defenseman Randy Carlyle, and prolific scorers Paul Gardner and Mike Bullard but little else.\n",
            "\n",
            "During the early part of the decade, the Penguins made a habit of being a tough draw for higher-seeded opponents in the playoffs. In 1980, the 13th-seeded Penguins took the Bruins to the limit in their first-round playoff series. The following season, as the 15th seed, they lost the decisive game of their first-round series in overtime to the heavily favored St. Louis Blues. Then, in the 1982 playoffs, the Penguins held a 3–1 lead late in the fifth and final game of their playoff series against the reigning champions, the New York Islanders. However, the Islanders rallied to force overtime and won the series on a goal by John Tonelli, who had tied the game before.[15] It would be the Penguins' final playoff appearance until 1989.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "-- Lemieux–Jagr era (1984–2005)\n",
            "The team had the league's worst record in both the 1982–83 and 1983–84 seasons. With the team suffering financial problems, it seemed the Penguins would either fold or relocate. Mario Lemieux, one of the most highly touted NHL draft picks in history, was due to be drafted in the 1984 NHL entry draft. Heading towards the end of the season ahead of the New Jersey Devils, who were placed last, the Penguins made several questionable moves that appeared to weaken the team in the short term. They posted three six-game winless streaks in the last 21 games of the season and earned the right to draft Lemieux amidst protests from Devils' management.[16] Pittsburgh head coach Lou Angotti later admitted that a conscious decision was made to finish the season as the team with the worst record, saying in an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that a mid-season lunch prompted the plan, because there was a high chance of the franchise folding if Lemieux was not drafted.[17] Other teams offered substantial trade packages for the draft choice, but the Penguins kept the pick and drafted Lemieux first overall. Lemieux paid dividends right away, scoring on his first-ever shot of his first-ever NHL shift in his first NHL game. However, the team spent four more years out of the playoffs after his arrival. In the late 1980s, the Penguins finally gave Lemieux a strong supporting cast, trading for superstar defenseman Paul Coffey from the Edmonton Oilers (after the Oilers' 1987 Stanley Cup win) and bringing in young talent like scorers Kevin Stevens, Rob Brown and John Cullen from the minors. The team finally acquired a top-flight goaltender with the acquisition of Tom Barrasso from Buffalo. All this talent had an immediate impact in helping Lemieux lead the Penguins; but the team struggled to make the playoffs. In 1985–86, the Penguins missed the playoffs on the final day of the season by one game. In 1986–87, they missed the playoffs by just two games and saw four teams with equal or worse records qualify. In 1987–88, for the second time in a row, the Penguins missed the playoffs by one game.[11]\n",
            "\n",
            "In 1989, Pittsburgh finally broke through the barrier and made the playoffs on the back of Lemieux leading the league in goals, assists and points. On December 31, 1988, Lemieux became the only player in history to score a goal in all five possible game situations in the same game (even strength, shorthanded, penalty shot, power play, and empty net). The Penguins defeated the New York Rangers in a four-game sweep in the first round; however, the Philadelphia Flyers halted their progress in the second round. The seven-game defeat featured Lemieux scoring five goals in the fifth game.[11]\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "-- Back-to-back Stanley Cup titles (1989–1997)\n",
            "A herniated disc in Lemieux's back cut short his 1989–90 season, although he still amassed 123 points. However, the Penguins fell out of the playoff picture. They opted to strengthen their roster and support Lemieux in the 1990 off-season. Free-agent signings (Bryan Trottier) and trades (Joe Mullen, Larry Murphy, Ron Francis and Ulf Samuelsson) played a major part in this. Arguably no move was bigger during this time than when the Penguins drafted Jaromir Jagr with the fifth overall pick in the 1990 NHL entry draft. The first Czechoslovak player to be drafted into the NHL without first needing to defect to the West, Jagr became the Penguins' second franchise player, and quickly developed into a superstar offensive talent.\n",
            "The roster overhaul culminated in the Penguins winning their first Stanley Cup title by defeating the Minnesota North Stars in the Stanley Cup Finals in six games, punctuated by an 8–0 victory in the deciding game, the largest margin of victory in a final Stanley Cup game in over 80 years. After the 1991 Stanley Cup Finals, the Penguins met with President George H. W. Bush, the first NHL team ever to visit the White House.[18] The following season, the team lost coach Bob Johnson to cancer, and Scotty Bowman took over as coach. Under Bowman, they swept the Chicago Blackhawks to repeat as Stanley Cup champions in 1991–92.[6][11]\n",
            "\n",
            "Cancer diagnosis revisited the Penguins in 1993 when Lemieux was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma. Only two months after the diagnosis, missing 24 out of 84 games, he came back to win his fourth Art Ross Trophy as scoring champion with 160 points, edging out Pat LaFontaine and Adam Oates. Despite the off-ice difficulties, Pittsburgh finished with a 56–21–7 record, the franchise's best regular season ever, winning the Presidents' Trophy. After Lemieux's return, the team played better than it had before, winning an NHL-record 17 consecutive games. Despite all of the success, the 1993 playoffs ended in the division finals when the New York Islanders eliminated the Penguins in seven games.[11][6]\n",
            "\n",
            "The Penguins continued to be a formidable team throughout the 1990s. The stars of the Stanley Cup years were followed by the likes of forwards: Alexei Kovalev, Martin Straka, Aleksey Morozov, Robert Lang and Petr Nedved, and defensemen Sergei Zubov, Darius Kasparaitis and Kevin Hatcher. Despite the departure of many of the franchise's Stanley Cup-winning roster, the Penguins fielded enough talent to reach the first round of the playoffs in 1994 (where they lost to the Washington Capitals in six games), the second round in 1995 (where they lost to the New Jersey Devils in five games) and the conference finals in 1996 (where they lost to the Florida Panthers in seven games). The 1997 playoffs marked a turning point, as the Penguins suffered a first-round elimination at the hands of the rival Philadelphia Flyers in five games.[11]\n",

            "On April 6, 1997, the franchise was rocked when Mario Lemieux, citing ongoing health concerns and his disapproval with the way NHL hockey was being officiated, announced he would retire at the conclusion of the 1997 playoffs. Lemieux was so respected in the NHL, and his achievements over the course of his career were so great, that he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the year he retired, the three-year waiting period being waived. His departure was the first in a series of events that would once again lead the Penguins into regular season stagnation, and to the brink of financial ruin.\n",

            "The Montreal Canadiens eliminated the team in the first round of the playoffs in 1998, despite being the second-seeded team in the East. The following year, their playoff run ended in the second round when they lost to the Toronto Maple Leafs in six games. In 2000, the Penguins stunned the highly touted Washington Capitals 4–1 in the first round, only to fall to the Philadelphia Flyers 4–2 in the second round.\n",

            "By this time, the lofty contracts handed out during the early 1990s were catching up with the Penguins. At one point, the team owed over $90 million to numerous creditors, leading then-owners Howard Baldwin and Morris Belzberg (who bought the Penguins after their first Stanley Cup win) to ask the players to defer their salaries to help pay the bills. When the deferred salaries finally came due, combined with other financial pressures, the Penguins were forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 1998.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lemieux then stepped in with an unusual proposal to buy the team out of bankruptcy. The Penguins owed Lemieux $32.5 million in deferred salary, making him the team's largest individual creditor. He proposed recovering this money by converting it into equity – enough to give him controlling interest. He also vowed to keep the team in Pittsburgh. The NHL and the courts agreed, and Lemieux (with help from supermarket tycoon Ronald Burkle) assumed control on September 3, 1999, saving the franchise for the second time.[6]\n",

            "Lemieux again shocked the hockey world by announcing at a press conference on December 8, 2000, his intentions to return to the Penguins as an active player. On December 27, 2000, Lemieux stepped onto NHL ice for the first time in 44 months, officially becoming the first player–owner in NHL history. Lemieux helped lead the Penguins deep into the 2001 playoffs, highlighted by an overtime victory against the Buffalo Sabres in game 7 of the second round. Darius Kasparaitis scored the series-clinching goal to advance the Penguins to the conference finals, where they lost in five games to the New Jersey Devils.[6]\n",

In 1998–99, the club had an average attendance of 14,825 at home games, the lowest it had been since Lemieux's rookie year.[19] Reducing revenue on top of the previous bankruptcy necessitated salary shedding. The biggest salary move was the trading of superstar Jaromir Jagr to the Washington Capitals in the summer of 2001. The Penguins missed the playoffs for the first time in 12 years in 2002, finishing in a tie for third-to-last in their conference. The following season they finished second-last. In the 2003 NHL entry draft, the Penguins selected goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury with the first overall pick.[20][21]\n",
            "\n",
            "The 2003–04 season was an ordeal with Lemieux missing all but 24 regular season games with a hip injury, and attendance dipping to an average of 11,877 (the lowest average of any NHL team), with just one sellout.[19] As the season progressed, the Penguins signed new head coach (and former Penguins' player and commentator) Eddie Olczyk and opted not to include Fleury in the lineup for the bulk of the season. This culminated in the worst record in the NHL, with the team winning just 23 games. As in the 1980s, the Penguins' struggles were fortuitously concurrent with a string of NHL entry draft classes that would yield multiple world-class talents. The Penguins lost out on the first overall pick for the 2004 NHL entry draft (Alexander Ovechkin), which went to the Washington Capitals. However, Ovechkin's countryman, center Evgeni Malkin, was similarly highly regarded, and Pittsburgh took him with the second overall pick. However, a transfer dispute between the NHL and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) delayed his Pittsburgh debut.[22]\n",

            "By this point, the Penguins had collapsed financially since the Stanley Cup-winning years of the early 1990s. Their home venue, the Civic Arena, had become the oldest arena in the NHL, and Lemieux had tried unsuccessfully to cut a deal with the city for a new facility. With Pittsburgh uninterested in building a new hockey arena for the struggling Penguins, Lemieux began looking into the possibilities of selling or relocating the team to Kansas City, Missouri.[23][24][25][26] A lockout prompted the cancellation of the 2004–05 NHL season. One of the many reasons for the lockout included disagreements on resolving the financial struggles of teams like the Penguins and the Ottawa Senators, which had filed for bankruptcy protection.[27] During the lockout, the Penguins' players dispersed between the club's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, and to European leagues.[6]\n",

The draft lottery, which was held behind closed doors in a \"secure location\", resulted in the Penguins being awarded the first overall pick.[28][29][30] Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) superstar Sidney Crosby (who had been training with Lemieux over the summer)[28] was the consensus first overall pick, with many referring to the draft lottery process as \"The Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes\". The Penguins selected Crosby on July 30, 2005, with the top pick, instantly rekindling interest in hockey in Pittsburgh.[11]\n",
            "\n",
            "The Penguins began rebuilding the team under the salary cap. However, Evgeni Malkin, the Penguins' 2004 draft pick, could not report to Pittsburgh immediately because of a playing rights dispute with the Russian Superleague. The addition of Crosby paid instant dividends, with attendance rising by approximately 4,000 per game on average in the 2005–06 season.[19] However, Crosby's presence did not immediately translate into wins, as the team began the season with a long winless skid that resulted in a head coaching change from Olczyk to Michel Therrien. Then, on January 24, 2006, Lemieux announced his second retirement, after developing an irregular heartbeat, this time permanently. He finished as the NHL's seventh all-time scorer (1,723), eighth in goals (690) and tenth in assists (1,033), and with the second-highest career points per game average (1.88), which is second to Wayne Gretzky's 1.92.[31][32]\n",

In the Penguins' final game of the season, Crosby tallied a goal and an assist to become the top-scoring rookie in Penguin history (eclipsing Lemieux). The Penguins again posted the worst record in the Eastern Conference and the highest goals-against total in the League. They received the second overall draft pick, their fourth top-two pick in four years, in the 2006 NHL entry draft, and selected touted two-way forward Jordan Staal. The team announced on April 20 they would not renew the contract for general manager Craig Patrick, who had been the general manager since December 1989.[33] On May 25, Ray Shero signed a five-year contract as general manager.\n",

It was the franchise's first 100-point season in 11 years and represented an enormous 47-point leap from the previous season. In the first round of the 2007 playoffs the eventual Stanley Cup runners-up, the Ottawa Senators, defeated the Penguins 4–1.

The completion of Consol Energy Center guaranteed that the Penguins would remain in Pittsburgh. Following the announcement of the plan, the Lemieux ownership group announced they no longer had plans to sell the team.

On April 2, 2008, the Penguins clinched the Atlantic Division title – their first division title in 10 years – with a 4–2 win against rivals the Philadelphia Flyers. Malkin finished the season with 106 points for second place in the league and finished as a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy. The team launched into their first extended playoff run in many years, beating Ottawa 4–0, defeating the New York Rangers 4–1 and then defeating the Philadelphia Flyers 4–1 to clinch the Prince of Wales Trophy.

The Penguins' record dipped mid-season but lifted after Dan Bylsma replaced head coach Therrien. The effect was almost instantaneous, and the Penguins recovered enough to secure home-ice advantage in their first-round match up against the Philadelphia Flyers, whom the Penguins defeated in six games. It took seven games for the Penguins to win the next series against Washington, sending them to the conference finals, where they eliminated the Carolina Hurricanes in a four-game sweep.

The Penguins also played two \"home\" games in the Cleveland suburb of Richfield, Ohio, in 1992 and 1993 at the Richfield Coliseum (this is not unlike the Cleveland Cavaliers of the NBA playing an annual pre-season game in Pittsburgh;[99] the Philadelphia 76ers used the Civic Arena as a second home in the early 1970s).[100]\n",

During the franchise's first pre-season training camp and pre-season exhibition games, the Brantford Civic Centre in Brantford, Ontario, served as its home,[101] and by the 1970s and continuing through the 1980s, the team was using the suburban Rostraver Ice Garden for training.\n",

The Penguins surprised observers by being ranked 20th overall and third among NHL teams, while the Steelers were ranked number one and the Pirates (before the arrival of Andrew McCutchen and that team's turnaround)[110] ranked much lower on the list than its peers.
