Expenditures Details - Department of Mobility and Infrastructure

- Mission

The mission of the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure is to provide the physical mobility necessary to
enable  the  social  and  economic  mobility  of  the  people  of  Pittsburgh  through  the  management,  design,
improvement and operation of the public rights of way.

- Departmental/Bureau Overview

The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure is responsible for all aspects of transportation and city-provided
mobility services, including:
     •     Planning transportation and mobility systems, corridors, and network operations
     •     Managing the flow of infrastructure funding
     •     Developing policies to guide the use of public right-of-ways and management of transportation systems
     •     Managing the public right-of-way to ensure continued safe, efficient and productive use that respects and
          implements city policies and public priorities
     •     Designing, operating and maintaining the transportation system for safe and efficient mobility of all modes
          to sustain and grow a vital, thriving, and equitable Pittsburgh
     •     Designing and implementing street and other infrastructure improvements in collaboration with community
          and public stakeholders
     •     Measuring and monitoring mobility performance with the goal of continuous learning and improvement

- The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) is comprised of three bureaus:

-- Planning, Policy and Permitting - The Planning, Policy and Permitting Bureau is led by the Assistant Director
and establishes the comprehensive vision, guiding policies and permitted uses of the urban mobility network and
public rights of way. It is comprised of three divisions:

     •     Planning  -  Oversees  development  of  system  plans  and  multimodal  networks  and  collaborates  on
          implementation; develops conceptual design of transportation facilities; gathers and analyzes data on the
          condition and use of the mobility system; coordinates with county and regional organizations and entities
          to plan transportation infrastructure improvements and mobility systems; and serves as the initial point of
          contact for public stakeholders and partners for general mobility concerns or initiatives. Additionally, the
          planning  division  tracks  development  of  the  regional  Transportation  Improvement  Program  (TIP),
          development of the department’s submission to the city’s Capital Improvement Plan, and pursuit of grants
          and other resources to support implementation of the transportation program.

     •     Policy - Develops, communicates and maintains policies for the use, management, design and oversight
          of public mobility services, transportation facilities and public rights of way; manages demand on the
          mobility system; and develops and maintains guidelines, standards, and processes for the use of public
          rights of way and the operation of the system and mobility services.

     •     Permitting, Inspections and ROW Coordination - Issues permits for use of or activities in the public
          rights of way in compliance with regulations and established policies; coordinates current and future
          activities with public and private utilities occupying the public rights of way; and enforces right of way use
          to ensure all activities in the public right of way are in compliance with established rules and regulations
          and the Pittsburgh Code via the inspection process. The Permit Division coordinates the activities of
          utilities  in  the  public  right  of  way  to  minimize  disruption  and  optimize  opportunities  for  cooperative
          improvements.

-- Traffic Operations - The Traffic Operations Bureau is led by the Municipal Traffic Engineer and oversees the
operation of the overall transportation and mobility network. The Bureau includes four divisions:

     •     Traffic  Design  Division  -  The  Design  Division  develops  design  standards  and  guidelines  for
          transportation facilities including travel way dimensions, assemblage, operation, markings, signage, and
          other components. The Division is central in the determining design of facilities for vehicles, bicycles and
          pedestrians. It provides programmatic guidance for complete street, safe routes to school and traffic
          calming improvements.

     •     Signal  Design  Division  –  The  Signal  Division  is  responsible  for  designing  the  programming  and
          operational plans for more than 600 signalized intersections throughout the city and designing plans for
          other devices such as school zone signs, rapid flash beacons, variable signs, and other elements. The
          Design Division assists the Planning Bureau in reviewing land development projects and specifically
          evaluating transportation impacts and necessary mitigations.

     •     Signs and Markings Division - The Signs and Markings Division fabricates, installs, repairs and/or
          replaces pavement markings, and signage. It is responsible for striping more than 2,000 miles of long
          markings, 10,000 marked crosswalks, and 850 traffic control and curbside regulatory signs. The Signs
          and Markings Division is typically responsible for the implementation of designs generated by the Design
          Division.

     •     Traffic Control Division - The Traffic Control Division performs necessary and routine maintenance on
          more than 10,000 traffic signal heads and other electronic traffic control devices across the City to keep
          them in operation.

-- Project Design and Delivery - The Project Design and Delivery Bureau is led by the Chief Engineer. The Bureau
is responsible for all of the major capital improvement projects for transportation or mobility infrastructure. This
includes not only street and bridge work, but also providing engineering services to address major slope failure
and flood control needs in the city. The Bureau is comprised of three divisions:

     •     Engineering  Design  Division  -  The  Engineering  Design  Division  completes  preliminary  and  final
          engineering for complex public infrastructure projects and oversees the construction services provided by
          City contractors. The Division supports the Permit Division through review of restoration or alteration of
          the public right of way carried out by private developments. Project Managers develop and maintain
          standards and specifications for construction in the public right of way; and inspect the condition of
          structures in the public right of way to ensure the safety of the traveling public.

     •     Paving Division - The Paving Division oversees City resurfacing projects on public streets, trail facilities
          and other public paved surfaces and the improvement of sidewalk ramps affected by this work. The
          Division is responsible for resurfacing more than 60 miles of streets every year in the city.

     •     Construction Division - The Construction Division of the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure
          addresses immediate needs for typically smaller scale improvements of infrastructure in the public rights
          of way. The Division oversees work to repair, replace or rehabilitate curbs, sidewalks, curb ramps, steps,
          walls, slopes and other similar projects. Division managers respond to emergency events that disrupt the
          safe operation of the mobility system such as landslides, sink holes, and bridge strikes.

- The three Bureaus of the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure are collectively responsible for:
     •     1,060 linear miles of streets (890 asphalt, 90 concrete, 80 brick/block stone)
     •     2,423 lane miles of streets (2,034 asphalt, 206 concrete, 183 brick/block stone)
     •     Tens of thousands of crosswalks and pavement markings
     •     675 sets of steps covering 23.3 lineal miles
     •     44,000 street lighting fixtures
     •     660 signalized intersections
     •     850,000 street signs
     •     33 miles of guide rail


- 2023 Accomplishments

     •     DOMI-Permits Policy & Planning - The Complete Streets Advisory Group (CSAG) was reconvened after a
          nearly 4 year hiatus! CSAG is comprised of government officials, advocates, technical experts, and
          citizens that are passionate about safety, equity and accessibility of city streets. The group will advise the
          Department in the creation of policy and procedures to further the goals of the City's Complete Streets
          Policy
     •     DOMI Projects Design & Delivery Division has increased staffing to better manage our bridge inventory.
          We have quadrupled spending on bridge maintenance and repairs in the last 12 months versus the
          previous 4 years
     •     DOMI-Traffic Division has continually evolved our team and program to better respond to constituent
          needs this year by:
     •     Installing new treatments to protect bike lanes (jersey barrier and precast concrete blocks)
     •     Launching an interactive GIS-based traffic calming portal
     •     Training new staff to take on more “Short term” projects
