- Mission

The Department of City Planning establishes and sustains an orderly and consistent approach to land use in the
City of Pittsburgh that incorporates sustainability, city design, resilience, equity, and opportunity in its work.  To
achieve this end, City Planning works with communities, civic organizations, and public entities to develop
policies, projects, and programs at the neighborhood and citywide scale and implements these policies through
regulations,  public  commissions,  and  review  of  land  development  plans,  master  plans,  and  projects  for
compliance with those policies and regulations.  The overriding goal is to sustain and enhance a thriving city of
neighborhoods for the people who live, work, learn, and visit here.  Planning works to develop citywide strategies,
rooted in principles of justice, equity, and the Just Transition, on how and why the City grows and changes
through the Comprehensive Plan.

- Departmental/Bureau Overview

Integrated Planning – A newly-created long-range division that focuses on topics related to an understanding of
people’s daily lives in order to eliminate inequities among Pittsburgh residents around access to affordable
housing, transportation options, healthy food and economic opportunity, and food and transit deserts.  Also
focuses  on    the  perpetuation  of  the  proliferation  of  vacant  land  and  to  develop  new  pathways  to  create
opportunities for residents.

Public History, Art, and Design – A division which ensures that art, culture, and history have a place in public
spaces, and that the design of public spaces and civic structures has a positive impact on the City’s public realm.
Our architecture, landmarks, historic districts, monuments, and artworks uplift community identity, public history,
and evolving culture in Pittsburgh. We care for and commission the physical representations of the stories that
comprise our public narrative.

Strategic Planning – A long-range division empowering communities to plan their future, providing a key link to
city government and resources through development and implementation of the City’s Comprehensive Plan and
Neighborhood Planning Program.

Sustainability & Resilience – A division which partners to protect and improve the environment for present and
future generations by imparting leadership for the integration of sustainability and resilience into the City’s
operations,  policies,  and  investments,  and  implementation  of  Pittsburgh’s  climate  planning  and  resilience
strategies.

Zoning & Development Review – A division that staffs the Planning Commission, Zoning Board of Adjustment,
and Contextual Design Advisory Panel with a focus on implementing the vision and plans for the City and its
neighborhoods through administration of the City’s Zoning Code.
