- Mission

The mission of the Office of Community Health and Safety is to  improve community safety and well-being, and
support public safety personnel by building a public health-informed response continuum.

- Departmental/Bureau Overview

The Office of Community Health and Safety is focused on building a response continuum and developing
sustainable upstream interventions to address unmet community social service needs that often fall to Public
Safety personnel, who represent the 24/7 safety net response.  Through partnerships and program development,
the Office will focus on:

Developing a Continuum of Support:  Through continued collaboration with first responders and community
members, analysis of calls for service, mapping of existing services, development of new partnerships, and
evaluation of existing models, the Office of Community Health & Safety (OCH&S) will establish a continuum of
resources and responders to address community unmet social service needs that are often encountered by Public
Safety partners.  First responder social support referrals, case conferencing and review, and service gap analysis
will be utilized to build this continuum.

Implementation  of  Public  Health-Informed  Practices:    Public  Safety  personnel  consistently  respond  to
community needs that exceed what they can provide in a single engagement model; however, first responders
have significant exposure to issues that affect community members’ health and well-being.  OCH&S will work with
the Department of Public Safety, public health entities, and academic partners to evaluate new programs and
responses to proactively address issues (especially upstream interventions) and reduce harm experienced by
community members.  Additionally, partners will evaluate best practices, facilitate focus groups, and elevate
translational experiences.

Consistent Community Engagement and Partnership:  Continued community engagement, transparency, and
accountability to the community and first responders is critical to building trust and facilitating change in the
current response continuum.  OCH&S will create a collaborative model of program development and evaluation,
prioritizing continuous review to ensure that deficits are quickly addressed and used for growth.  OCH&S will
partner with existing community organizations and prioritize community members who have been harmed and
may not engage in traditional meetings.  Initial efforts will focus on creation of multiple advisory collaboratives
focused on Black neighborhoods most harmed by the war on drugs and systemic racism.

Note: The Office of Community Health full time positions can be found in the Stop the Violence trust fund.

- 2023 Accomplishments
    •     Launch of Co-Response in 2023 in Police Zones 1 & 2, which includes Downtown Pittsburgh. In the last
         month alone, the team has successfully prevented 3 jumpers from reaching completion. It also played an
         integral role in resolving a 90+ person migrant crisis at the Greyhound. In total, it has seen 107 patients
         served, 307 service encounters, and 143 reasons for referral since April 2023.
    •     Launch of the Trauma Survivors Assistance Program this summer, with already achieving over 700
         encounters and providing support to the community during and after the Garfield shooting.
    •     The Office of Community Health & Safety launched a Downtown Crisis Response Case Conference with
         DHS Leadership, outreach organizations, and OCHS Leadership to best address the most complex cases
         affecting downtown. The target audience are individuals who are in crisis, experience homelessness and
         extreme poverty, and have high engagement with law enforcement and the criminal/legal system.
    •     Secured $1 million in federal funding to launch Post Overdose Support Teams (POST) next year which
         will  perform  secondary  response  to  individuals  who  refuse  medical  treatment  after  experiencing  an
         overdose. The team will consist of certified peer recovery specialists and case managers. The response
         will foster a connection that places the individual in a deescalated state following the overdose and
         provide social and service supports to prevent future overdoses
    •     The Community Partnership Specialist ensures that the diversity of experiences, perspectives, and needs
         remains at the forefront of each program. To date we have: Distributed over 1,000 Narcan, 500 fentanyl
         test strips, 820 gun safety locks, 300 CPR face shields and attended and tabled 6 harm reduction fairs in
         the City in collaboration with the Allegheny County Health Department. Additionally, we have participated
         in 4 City in the Streets and organized International Overdose Awareness Day, with over 35 providers
         tabled at event
