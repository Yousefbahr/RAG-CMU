Background

On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and it became public law. One
component of the American Rescue Plan allocated $350 billion to eligible state, local, territorial, and Tribal
governments to respond to the COVID-19 emergency. The City of Pittsburgh received an allocation totaling
$335,070,222 from the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund (CSLFRF). The first tranche was
received in June 2021; the second and final tranche was received in June 2022.

These funds may used in one of the following four statutory categories:

    1.   To respond to the COVID-19 public health emergency or its negative economic impacts;
    2.   To respond to workers performing essential work during the COVID-19 public health emergency by
         providing  premium  pay  to  such  eligible  workers  of  the  recipient,  or  by  providing  grants  to  eligible
         employers that have eligible workers who performed essential work;
    3.   For the provision of government services, to the extent of the reduction in revenue of such recipient due
         to the COVID–19 public health emergency, relative to revenues collected in the most recent full fiscal year
         of the recipient prior to the emergency; and
    4.   To make necessary investments in water, sewer, or broadband infrastructure.
