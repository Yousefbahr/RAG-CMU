Expenditures Details - Citizen Police Review Board

Mission

The Independent Citizen Police Review Board ("CPRB") promotes responsible citizenship and respectable law
enforcement through mutual accountability.  The broad mandate of the Citizen Police Review Board is to provide
independent review of the conduct of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.  To accomplish this assignment, the Board
will thoroughly investigate specific allegations of misconduct, hold public hearings to examine such allegations;
evaluate current police procedures and promote safe, professional and effective law enforcement practices
through public education on rights, responsibilities and police authority; and make recommendations to the Mayor
and Chief of Police regarding police policies and procedures.

A Board comprised of seven members appointed by the Mayor and City Council presides over the work of the
staff and determines all final dispositions of cases. The Board conducts public hearings and renders findings and
recommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor as related to the matter or complaint under review.

Departmental/Bureau Overview

Investigation and Complaint Disposition - Citizens must file a notice of intent to file a citizen complaint with the
CPRB within six months of the incident from which the complaint arises. Upon contact from a citizen, the Intake
Coordinator evaluates the complaint for administrative compliance and initiates the internal case management of
the complaint. The Intake Coordinator informs the complainant of his/her rights and responsibilities related to the
complaint. The Executive Director or the Assistant Executive Director reviews each citizen complaint, develops a
preliminary investigative plan and assigns the case to an Investigator. The Assistant Executive Director provides
daily supervision and oversight of case investigations. Investigators conduct preliminary inquiries into cases and
the results are presented to the Board.  The Board considers the evidence and determines whether to further an
investigation into the allegations of misconduct or to dismiss the complaint. Complaints may proceed through
investigation to a public hearing at the Board’s discretion.  Findings and recommendations resulting from public
hearings are forwarded to the Mayor and Chief of Police who must respond to the Board.  Patterns emerging from
complaints  and  allegations  of  misconduct  may  be  presented  to  the  Board  for  consideration  of  policy
recommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor.

Community Education - The goal of community education and outreach is to improve relations between citizens
and police by developing or enhancing common knowledge of police authority, practices and procedures, and
civilian expectations of police conduct.  Outreach utilizes printed material, traditional and social media, and
personal appearances of members and staff to ensure the public has an opportunity to be informed of the CPRB’s
role and common rights and responsibilities of citizenship.  The effort directed to citizens (1) ensures that the
public is adequately prepared to respond to police encounters in a manner conducive to the safety of the citizen
and  the  officer,  and  (2)  conveys  information  on  filing  complaints  when  such  encounters  are  perceived  as
offensive.  The outreach to police officers is designed to encourage participation in investigations, explain the
process, and integrate their concerns into the community education effort.

Board and Staff Development - Training for Members encompasses topics mandated by City Ordinance,
including police training, police policies and procedures, criminal, civil and constitutional law as well as human
rights and contemporary practices of civilian review of law enforcement policies and police behavior.  Staff training
is designed to enhance investigative skills, utilize technology for research and case management, and develops
mediation and conciliation skills as well as crisis management and safety skills. Staff adheres to the standards
and performance objectives expected of Certified Police Oversight Professionals.

Administrative     - The Executive Director is responsible for administering the policies and procedures of the Board
and those of the City which affect the daily operation of the Independent Citizen Police Review Board.  Activities
of this core service include the planning, organization, development, evaluation, and implementation of efficient
and effective management strategies of fiscal, personnel, information systems, and related support to maximize
the  utility  of  the  resources  available.  The  Assistant  Executive  Director  facilitates  daily  administrative
communication and serves as liaison to the administrative departments of the City.
