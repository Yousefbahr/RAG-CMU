Mission

The Bureau of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) is dedicated to the reduction of morbidity and mortality of
residents and visitors through the provision of Advanced and Basic Life Support pre-hospital care, medically
directed rescue, and transportation of the ill and injured.

Departmental/Bureau Overview

The Bureau of EMS provides advanced life support, pre-hospital care, and transportation for the sick and injured
through the deployment of thirteen advanced life support ambulances, each staffed by Pennsylvania Department
of Health Certified Paramedics. In addition to the advanced life support units the bureau also staffs four basic life
support ambulances staffed by Pennsylvania Department of Health Certified Emergency Medical Technicians.
Strategically located throughout the City, the Bureau will operate thirteen advanced life support (ALS) and three
basic life support (BLS) ambulances 24 hours per day when at full staffing capacity.

With advanced training and technology, the Bureau of EMS is delivering cutting-edge care by providing new
treatment modalities that allow for more effective recognition and treatment of heart attacks, strokes, cardiac
arrest, and a number of other life threatening conditions. For patients experiencing ST Elevation Myocardial
Infarction (STEMI), EMS has the ability to screen and directly transmit an EKG to the receiving hospital and
activate the cardiac cauterization laboratory prior to arrival, greatly reducing the time to definitive treatment.

The Bureau of EMS also provides integrated medically-directed rescue for vehicle accidents, industrial accidents,
high and low angle rope rescues, confined space emergencies, building collapse, elevator emergencies, and
others. The base service is comprised of two specially equipped rescue trucks, each staffed by two paramedics,
operating 24 hours a day. All Pittsburgh Paramedics are trained and certified for vehicle and basic rescue
practices. Those paramedics assigned to the Rescue Division receive additional rescue training and certifications.

The Bureau of EMS is also an integral part of three joint public safety teams: River Rescue, SWAT, and the
Hazardous Materials (Hazmat) Team. For each team, EMS provides an administrative and leadership role as well
as a cadre of highly qualified personnel and instructors.

For River Rescue, EMS provides two Paramedic Public Safety SCUBA divers to staff the units. The Bureau of
Police assigns an officer/helmsman who provides a law enforcement component to the units. This unit conducts
port security and safety patrols on a routine basis.

For the SWAT Team, EMS provides trained Tactical EMS (TEMS) personnel who have undergone all of the
required SWAT training in addition to specialized treatment under fire training. They respond as an integral
element of the SWAT Team to multiple incidents such as barricaded persons, high risk warrants, and dignitary
protection.

For the Hazmat Team, EMS participates with the Bureaus of Fire and Police, providing personnel trained and
certified to the Technician level for entry, evaluation, mitigation, and decontamination. EMS also provides the
required medical monitoring for pre-entry and post-entry for an incident.
