Expenditures Details - Department of Finance

Mission

The Finance Department provides fiscal leadership for the City focused on long-term financial health while
respecting the interests of its residents.  It also carries an important responsibility to ensure all entrepreneurs,
visionaries, and leaders have the necessary services and city infrastructure to thrive.  As the City of Pittsburgh’s
primary revenue generator, the Finance Department is committed to excellence in financial management for the
City, its residents, and its businesses.

Departmental/Bureau Overview

The Finance Department is responsible for the collection, deposit, and investment of all funds received by the City
from any source. The Department bills and collects tax and fee revenue, intergovernmental payments, grant
payments, lease payments, and other payments due to the City. The Department also manages tax abatements
(including homestead and senior citizen exemptions), tracks tax increments, and performs tax audits designed to
help businesses submit returns timely and enforce tax laws. The Department is also the designated tax collector
for the Pittsburgh School District and the Carnegie Library.

In addition to collections of revenue, the Finance Department performs a number of other functions. This includes
the sale of tax delinquent properties through Treasurer’s Sales, sale of City-owned property, tax assessment
appeals, and citywide cash management. The Department performs business tax audits and ensures that money
owed to the City is collected in a timely manner. The Department also manages City debt through bonds and
borrowing and manages the City’s Comprehensive Municipal Pension Trust Fund. To ensure accuracy and
transparency the Department also facilitates citywide annual single and pension audits.

The Department has five major divisions, each with several sub-sections, led by the Director and Deputy Director.

Administration and Treasury Division - The Director of Finance oversees all departmental functions and
policies and is responsible for managing debt functions. The Director also oversees all collections and billing of
taxes as City Treasurer and is responsible for communicating and interacting with the City Council. The Director/
City  Treasurer  units  are  responsible  for  managing  all  administrative  functions.  The  City  Treasurer  is  the
designated Treasurer for the Pittsburgh School District, is responsible for tax collections related to the District, and
is the responsible agent for the collection and distribution of the Carnegie Library portion of real estate taxes. The
Treasurer oversees the collection of the earned income tax through the City’s contractor, Jordan Tax Services.

Business Intelligence Division - The Business Intelligence Unit (BIU) reports to the Director of Finance. This
unit is responsible for all operation improvement projects within the Department as well as citywide organizational
processes and performance. This unit manages all requests for proposals originating in the department, manages
projects to include major technology updates, and recommends and implements new datasets and open data
initiatives. The Business Intelligence Unit is also responsible for managing the credit card programs citywide and
all legislation processes required to manage citywide contracts. It is also responsible for creating policies to align
with department goals to increase efficiency and productivity. The unit focuses on improvements that will help
increase revenue as well as lower operational costs citywide.

Real Estate Division - This unit manages all real estate activity including property tax, city property sales,
Treasurer's sales as well as abatement and delinquencies. The Real Estate division is the designated collector for
the Pittsburgh School District and Carnegie Library and ensures that the property tax and any delinquencies on
accounts are collected for the current year. The Real Estate division manages the entire real estate inventory
online for the public to search and apply for properties that are for sale. The division works with property buyers,
delinquency collectors, the School District, County Assessor’s Office, the Urban Redevelopment Authority, and the
Law department to return property to the tax rolls and expedite the sales processes.


Tax Compliance Division - This division houses all compliance and enforcement activities and is the front facing
counter  that  manages  tax  compliance  letters  and  new  business  registrations. The  tax  compliance  team  is
responsible  for  discovering  new  businesses,  collecting  business  taxes  and  fees,  performing  audits  and
investigations, and issuing citations to ensure that all money owed is collected and that taxpayers comply with the
City ordinance.

Cash Management Division - This unit ensures all collections are processed timely and accurately. This area
includes cashiering, imaging, data entry, investment, insurance and bonds, ACH grants, and all activities related
to the City Controller’s daily revenue posting. The division expedites the deposit and/or transfer of revenues to
manage the distribution of funds citywide.
