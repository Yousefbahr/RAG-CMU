-- The Great Search: Art in a Time of Change, 1928–1945 (Part 2)
The Great Search: Art in a Time of Change, 1928–1945 surveys the period from the beginning of the Great Depression to the end of World War II to demonstrate how pluralism was a hallmark of the modern American art world. This exhibition features works by Ernest Fiene, Arthur Dove, and others. Experience the second phase of this exciting exhibition with new artworks recently conserved and on view for the first time.The Great Search's title references American Art Today, the World’s Fair exhibition held in New York City in 1939. Organizer Holger Cahill, then national director of the Federal Art Project, spoke in his address of the modern artist’s “search that takes many paths”—a yearning desire to seek out new and enduring forms that would aid democracy. One of The Westmoreland’s best-known and loved paintings, Ernest Fiene’s Night Shift, Aliquippa (1936), was included in this pivotal presentation. Drawn primarily from The Westmoreland’s collection, amplified by key loans, the exhibition will provide fresh insight into the individuals, experiences, and both new and traditional aesthetics that define American modern art.

-- Treasures from the National Academy of Design
Works from the National Academy of Design, alongside pieces from The Westmoreland’s collection by National Academicians, offer a unique narrative of American art from the 1800s to today. The exhibition includes portraits, as well as other works, by artists from both the Academy and the Museum’s collection, including Thomas Eakins, Henry Ossawa Tanner, and John Singer Sargent. Since its founding in 1825, each elected National Academician has donated a work to the collection, including portraits of members—either self-painted or created by fellow artists.

-- A Fountain of Forms: The Rise of the American Woman Sculptor, 1910–1929
A Fountain of Forms: The Rise of the American Woman Sculptor, 1910–1929 showcases remarkable depictions of the female body by women artists, highlighting their subversion of gender and sexuality conventions. Despite societal constraints, artists like Harriet Whitney Frishmuth, Malvina Hoffman, and Janet Scudder—who were queer women—used their focus on the nude human figure to assert their individuality and autonomy in an age of increasing, rapid mechanization and patriarchal control. The exhibition, drawn from The Westmoreland’s exceptional sculpture collection, celebrates the transformative gift from Dr. Michael L. Nieland in 2015. This exhibition reflects his lifelong dedication to figurative sculpture and the museum’s rich history of statuary.

-- Good Business: Andy Warhol’s Screenprints
Good Business: Andy Warhol’s Screenprints examines why screenprints are an essential part of Warhol’s body of work. Facilitating experimentation and mass distribution, prints can be simultaneously challenging and accessible.Warhol embraced mechanical processes early in his career and found in screenprinting the perfect vehicle for image repetition, both for his works on canvas and for portfolios of prints on paper. Through collaborations with his studio assistants and established print publishers, Warhol generated nearly 20,000 prints throughout his career. Screenprinting techniques allowed him to create series of images in an assortment of color variations, resulting in one of his most recognizable signatures (the same image rendered in different colorways), while the ability to generate editions of prints on paper enabled collectors to acquire masterworks at (relatively) affordable prices. The salability of prints also raised funds for causes that were personally important to him.Good Business: Andy Warhol’s Screenprints provides insight into the screenprinting process and highlights how Warhol used this technique to explore familiar themes throughout his career. Warhol was many things—a painter, photographer, film director, entrepreneur and commercial artist. Printmaker is a critical part of that extensive resume.Andy Warhol, $ (1), 1982, © The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.

-- PGHwrites: Marcus Rediker “Freedom Ship” (Book Launch)
From the award-winning author of 2007’s The Slave Ship, we celebrate the book launch of Marcus Rediker’s latest work: Freedom Ship: The Uncharted History of Escaping Slavery by Sea. Freedom Ship is a definitive, sweeping account of the Underground Railroad’s long-overlooked maritime origins, deftly navigated by Marcus Rediker, a pre-eminent scholar of Atlantic history and professor at the University of Pittsburgh. In this enlightening book launch event, Marcus will be joined in conversation by moderator Tony Norman, an award-winning columnist and feature writer.Described as “A triumph of storytelling as well as of archival recovery,” by Amitav Ghosh (author of Sea of Poppies), Freedom Ship offers a groundbreaking new look into the secret world of stowaways and the vessels that carried them to freedom across the North and into Canada.As many as 100,000 enslaved people fled successfully from the horrors of bondage in the antebellum South, finding safe harbor along a network of passageways across North America now known as the Underground Railroad. The truth often untold? Many of these harrowing escape journeys took place not by land but by sea. Deeply researched and grippingly told, Freedom Ship sprawls through the intricate riverways of the Carolinas, to the banks of the Chesapeake Bay, to Boston’s harbors, illuminating the little-known stories of freedom seekers who turned their sights to the sea—among them the legendary abolitionist Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman, one of the Underground Railroad’s most famous architects.Marcus Rediker puts his command of archival research on full display in this luminous portrait of the Atlantic waterfront as a place of conspiracy, mutiny, and liberation. Freedom Ship is essential reading for anyone looking to understand the complete story of one of North America’s most significant historical moments.Purchase a copy of Marcus’ book, Freedom Ship, at City of Asylum Bookstore.

-- Brynn Hurlstone: Resonance
Brynn Hurlstone: Resonance is an interactive exhibition that addresses the pervasive, yet often unseen, issue of domestic violence. A transdisciplinary artist, Hurlstone uses reactive materials—steel, glass, water, salt, silk, cotton, paper, and wood—to create an environment that “is alive, in continual transformation, and activated by human presence.” Visitors are invited to accept or refuse multiple levels of engagement: as they step on steel plates, water spills from spotlighted glass vessels, forming rust drawings that slowly weaken the steel beneath; the gentle breeze created by walking through the space ruffles delicate silk panels, slowly fraying their edges over time; books of poetry printed with rust and bound with silk sutures can be picked up, examined, and contemplated to further uncover the stories that fill the exhibition.

-- The Great Search: Art in a Time of Change, 1928–1945 (Part 2)
The Great Search: Art in a Time of Change, 1928–1945 surveys the period from the beginning of the Great Depression to the end of World War II to demonstrate how pluralism was a hallmark of the modern American art world. This exhibition features works by Ernest Fiene, Arthur Dove, and others. Experience the second phase of this exciting exhibition with new artworks recently conserved and on view for the first time.The Great Search's title references American Art Today, the World’s Fair exhibition held in New York City in 1939. Organizer Holger Cahill, then national director of the Federal Art Project, spoke in his address of the modern artist’s “search that takes many paths”—a yearning desire to seek out new and enduring forms that would aid democracy. One of The Westmoreland’s best-known and loved paintings, Ernest Fiene’s Night Shift, Aliquippa (1936), was included in this pivotal presentation. Drawn primarily from The Westmoreland’s collection, amplified by key loans, the exhibition will provide fresh insight into the individuals, experiences, and both new and traditional aesthetics that define American modern art.

-- A Fountain of Forms: The Rise of the American Woman Sculptor, 1910–1929
A Fountain of Forms: The Rise of the American Woman Sculptor, 1910–1929 showcases remarkable depictions of the female body by women artists, highlighting their subversion of gender and sexuality conventions. Despite societal constraints, artists like Harriet Whitney Frishmuth, Malvina Hoffman, and Janet Scudder—who were queer women—used their focus on the nude human figure to assert their individuality and autonomy in an age of increasing, rapid mechanization and patriarchal control. The exhibition, drawn from The Westmoreland’s exceptional sculpture collection, celebrates the transformative gift from Dr. Michael L. Nieland in 2015. This exhibition reflects his lifelong dedication to figurative sculpture and the museum’s rich history of statuary.

-- Good Business: Andy Warhol’s Screenprints
Good Business: Andy Warhol’s Screenprints examines why screenprints are an essential part of Warhol’s body of work. Facilitating experimentation and mass distribution, prints can be simultaneously challenging and accessible.Warhol embraced mechanical processes early in his career and found in screenprinting the perfect vehicle for image repetition, both for his works on canvas and for portfolios of prints on paper. Through collaborations with his studio assistants and established print publishers, Warhol generated nearly 20,000 prints throughout his career. Screenprinting techniques allowed him to create series of images in an assortment of color variations, resulting in one of his most recognizable signatures (the same image rendered in different colorways), while the ability to generate editions of prints on paper enabled collectors to acquire masterworks at (relatively) affordable prices. The salability of prints also raised funds for causes that were personally important to him.Good Business: Andy Warhol’s Screenprints provides insight into the screenprinting process and highlights how Warhol used this technique to explore familiar themes throughout his career. Warhol was many things—a painter, photographer, film director, entrepreneur and commercial artist. Printmaker is a critical part of that extensive resume.Andy Warhol, $ (1), 1982, © The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.

Freedom Ship is a definitive, sweeping account of the Underground Railroad’s long-overlooked maritime origins, deftly navigated by Marcus Rediker, a pre-eminent scholar of Atlantic history and professor at the University of Pittsburgh. In this enlightening book launch event, Marcus will be joined in conversation by moderator Tony Norman, an award-winning columnist and feature writer.Described as “A triumph of storytelling as well as of archival recovery,” by Amitav Ghosh (author of Sea of Poppies), Freedom Ship offers a groundbreaking new look into the secret world of stowaways and the vessels that carried them to freedom across the North and into Canada.As many as 100,000 enslaved people fled successfully from the horrors of bondage in the antebellum South, finding safe harbor along a network of passageways across North America now known as the Underground Railroad. The truth often untold? Many of these harrowing escape journeys took place not by land but by sea. Deeply researched and grippingly told, Freedom Ship sprawls through the intricate riverways of the Carolinas, to the banks of the Chesapeake Bay, to Boston’s harbors, illuminating the little-known stories of freedom seekers who turned their sights to the sea—among them the legendary abolitionist Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman, one of the Underground Railroad’s most famous architects.Marcus Rediker puts his command of archival research on full display in this luminous portrait of the Atlantic waterfront as a place of conspiracy, mutiny, and liberation. Freedom Ship is essential reading for anyone looking to understand the complete story of one of North America’s most significant historical moments.Purchase a copy of Marcus’ book, Freedom Ship, at City of Asylum Bookstore.

A transdisciplinary artist, Hurlstone uses reactive materials—steel, glass, water, salt, silk, cotton, paper, and wood—to create an environment that “is alive, in continual transformation, and activated by human presence.” Visitors are invited to accept or refuse multiple levels of engagement: as they step on steel plates, water spills from spotlighted glass vessels, forming rust drawings that slowly weaken the steel beneath; the gentle breeze created by walking through the space ruffles delicate silk panels, slowly fraying their edges over time; books of poetry printed with rust and bound with silk sutures can be picked up, examined, and contemplated to further uncover the stories that fill the exhibition.

-- The Art of Elizabeth Catlett from the Collection of Samella Lewis
This exhibition celebrates Elizabeth Catlett’s achievements in sculpture and printmaking and honors a half-century of her artistic activism in support of women. A trailblazing sculptor and printmaker, Catlett spent seven decades creating art that honored the dignity and strength of marginalized communities. Her powerful depictions of laborers, women, and African Americans address social issues relevant in both the United States and Mexico.Drawn from the collection of Dr. Samella Lewis (1924–2022)—an artist, historian, and Catlett’s former student—this exhibition highlights Catlett’s impact as an artist and educator. It celebrates her lasting influence and the ways she merged art and activism to inspire change.This exhibition is curated by Dr. Grace Hampton.
