ARTICLE 6: SAVINGS 
 
ยง 601.  SAVINGS CLAUSE AND SEVERABILITY. 
 
(a)  If a final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction holds any 
provisions of these Regulations, or the application of any provision to 
any circumstances, to be illegal or unconstitutional, the other 
provisions in these regulations, or the application of such provision to 
other circumstances, shall remain in full force and effect.  The intent 
of the Treasurer is that the provisions of these Regulations shall be 
severable and that they would have been adopted if any such illegal 
or unconstitutional provisions had not been included herein.
 
 
(b)   Should a court of competent jurisdiction determine this provision to be 
invalid for any reason, Persons subject to the Usage Fee shall not be 
exempt from any previously applicable earned income tax.
