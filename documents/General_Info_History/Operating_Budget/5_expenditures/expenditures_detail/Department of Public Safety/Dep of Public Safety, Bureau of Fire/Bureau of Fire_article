Expenditures Details - Department of Public Safety, Bureau of Fire

Mission

It is the mission of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire (PBF) to protect life, property, and the environment by providing
effective  customer  and  human  services  related  to  fire  suppression,  emergency  medical  services,  hazard
mitigation, emergency management services, and domestic preparedness.

The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire encourages all personnel to take a proactive role in reducing the impact from
emergencies  by  providing  programs  related  to  fire  prevention,  public  education,  community  relations,  risk
reduction, disaster planning, homeland security, and operational training. All services provided to the residents
and visitors of the City of Pittsburgh, the County of Allegheny, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will be
delivered in the most professional manner, to the best of our ability.

Departmental/Bureau Overview

The roles and responsibilities of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire as related to public safety include emergency
medical  care,  fire  investigation,  code  enforcement,  training,  logistics,  and  suppression.  Suppression  and
emergency  medical  services  are  the  largest  functional  area  in  terms  of  responsibility  and  resources.  The
suppression function is the activity of containing and extinguishing a fire. The goals of the suppression division are
to protect lives, property and the environment. The PBF expanded its emergency medical service capabilities by
becoming a licensed emergency medical care provider issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Health. The
Bureau provides these services through the following four divisions:

Administration - Provides managerial and administrative services for the Bureau.  This activity includes budget
and  finance;  payroll;  employee  relations,  strategic  planning;  record  and  data  gathering,  facility  and  fleet
management.

Operations - Provides emergency incident response to protect the lives and property of city residents and
visitors. In addition to extinguishing fires, controlling hazardous material emergency incidents, flood response, and
emergency management, the personnel in this service area are responsible for providing emergency medical care
to sick and injured individuals. The Fire Bureau responds to approximately 20,000 emergency medical calls each
year.

Planning and Training - Provides training, communications, and logistics for the Bureau of Fire. The Training
Academy implements employee development programs for fire suppression personnel. The programs consist of
fire suppression, apparatus driving operations, emergency medical responder, hazardous material, technical
rescue, vehicle rescue, and disaster response topics. The PBF expanded its role in disaster preparedness and
response, which includes increased capabilities to provide swift-water rescue, as well as taking a proactive role in
planning and preparation for a disaster involving crude oil being transported by rail through the City of Pittsburgh,
and other transportation emergencies. All new recruits must complete 32 weeks of basic training before being
assigned to a permanent station within the PBF. In addition to recruit training, continuing education is required for
all members of the PBF. The Bureau also provides public education to various community organizations and City
programs such as the Civic Leadership Academy.

Risk Management - Enforces the City’s hazardous material code, the International Fire Code, investigates
complaints of life-threatening and unsafe conditions, and conducts fire investigations. It is also responsible for the
health and safety of Bureau employees through preventive and corrective measures.
