His daughter Barbara Karp took over her father's duties during his final illness.  James DeBlasis then served as interim artistic director after the resignation of Barbara Karp.  In 1983,Tito Capobiancobecame Pittsburgh Opera's general director, holding this position until 1997.[4]From 1997 to 2000, Capobianco was the company's artistic director, before leaving in 2000.[5]
