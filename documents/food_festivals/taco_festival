About the 2024 Pittsburgh Taco Festival | September 14th, 2024


- About us
The Pittsburgh Taco Festival®is an annual food festival aimed at celebrating (and eating) TACOS, as well as supporting and raising funds and awareness for the city’s Latin-American community.

- history
The Original Pittsburgh Taco Festival® was founded in 2016 by Craig McCloud who sought to create an opportunity which benefitted food trucks/start-ups as well as support non-profits that serve the city’s burgeoning Latin American population. The festival regularly attracts vendors from beyond the metro area, as well as visitors who plan weekend visits from New York, Ohio, Maryland, West Virginia, and beyond. Over the years, tens of thousands of people have joined us for what has become an annually anticipated cultural and community event. We hope you’ll join us, too!

- 2025 Taco Festival Producer
This event celebrates community and is produced by thePittsburgh Hispanic Development Corporation(PHDC), a community and economic development organization. A portion of the proceeds directly benefits PHDC’s mission. “TacoFest is more than a celebration of food — it’s a celebration of people. More than half of the participating Taco vendors are from the PHDC Incubator program with authentic and traditional flavors from Mexico!” says Guillermo Velazquez, Executive Director of Pittsburgh Hispanic Development Corporation.
