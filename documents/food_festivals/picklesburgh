- History
The inaugural Picklesburgh festival took place on July 17 and 18, 2015, on theRachel Carson BridgeinDowntown Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania.[2]Organized by the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, a non-profit organization, and sponsored primarily by Pittsburgh-basedHeinz(nowKraft Heinz), the festival was inspired by Pittsburgh's rich history ofpickling.[9][10]Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership president Jeremy Waldrup explained that pickles "speak to the ethnic, cultural history of Pittsburgh, as amelting potforEastern Europeanethnic communities",[11]although numerous countries ofWestern culturewith significant diasporas in the United States, likeGermanyandPoland, also employ pickling in their national cuisines. According to Waldrup, the festival was also inspired by the growingfarm-to-tablemovement and the trend ofurban homesteading.[9]
At Picklesburgh 2016, the second annual festival held at Rachel Carson Bridge, Heinz debuted their first new pickle flavors in over 50 years.[12]The 2017 festival was held at the nearbyRoberto Clemente Bridge, where it also took place in 2018 and 2019, gradually taking up more abutting street space each year.[13][14]Having begun as a two-day festival in 2015, a three-day schedule was established in 2018,[15]although a four-day schedule was used in 2024 before returning to three days in 2025.[16][17]Picklesburgh was canceled in 2020 due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, but it returned in 2021 with additional safety precautions on theAndy Warhol Bridge.[18]
In 2022, the festival returned to its original locale on the Rachel Carson Bridge, with food vendors along the neighboring 10th Street Bypass.[19]Picklesburgh 2022 drew 90,000 attendees, leading organizers to periodically close the Rachel Carson Bridge to preventovercrowding.[20]Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership director Jack Dougherty remarked, "At times, especially during our peak hours, it would get very crowded and just kind of become a little uncomfortable for everyone in attendance."[21]
In response, for its 2023 installment, the festival was relocated to a larger venue occupying three blocks of theBoulevard of the AlliesbetweenStanwix Streetand Smithfield Street, and alongMarket StreetintoPPG Place.[6]Even with its larger location, Picklesburgh 2023 still saw enormous shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, with attendance more than doubling to 200,000 visitors.[22]Amid mid-summer heat and huge crowds, 16 attendees were hospitalized due toheat exhaustionand other ailments.[23]
